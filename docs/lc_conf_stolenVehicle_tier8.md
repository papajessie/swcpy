# Ultra Chrome Conflict Crate (lc_conf_stolenVehicle_tier8)

Crates are given as rewards for various actions. The content is revealed only when opening them, by drawing once (or more) in various prize pools. Only one prize is won for each pool per draw. The in-game description of expectations is written manually and can be wrong. The probability of obtaining one prize is indicated below; the pools change according to planet, faction and HQ level.

This crate expires after 7d. The contents are decided by 4 draws from 3 different pools.
  * 1 draw from pool "lcpool_creditsAlloy_conf8"
  * 1 draw from pool "lcpool_currency_conf8"
  * 2 draws from pool "lcpool_stolenVehicle_conf8"
