    dia_cha_11_tbft_e_11_intro1 'Greetings, Operative. I have reviewed the reports from your battles. While Kosh has repeatedly undervalued your contribution, I can read between the lines.'
    dia_cha_11_tbft_e_11_intro2 'Your relentless drive to crush the traitorous Rebels on Tatooine speaks highly of you and your command potential.'
    dia_cha_11_tbft_e_11_intro3 'You should be pleased to hear you are to be transferred to my command shortly. Your time on this sand-ridden backwater will soon be over.'

    dia_cha_11_tbft_e_1_outro1 'We have not always seen eye to eye, Operative. But I believe we can both agree that crushing the Rebellion on Tatooine is of the utmost importance.'
    dia_cha_11_tbft_e_1_outro2 "Intelligence section has put together a plan to accomplish this. One that I've personally approved. Let's get to work."
    dia_cha_11_tbft_e_2_intro1 "Rebels use these transports for ferrying their supplies and troops across the sector. Kessen's people have seen to it that their drives are in need of repair."
    dia_cha_11_tbft_e_2_intro2 'While they are grounded here, you will destroy them. Deny the Rebels their ability to obtain reinforcements while we systematically wipe them out.'
    dia_cha_11_tbft_e_2_outro1 "Kosh's plan ain't bad, partner. Without shuttles to move their troops, the Rebels can't retreat. We can run them to ground."
    dia_cha_11_tbft_e_2_outro2 'Exactly correct, operative Saponza. We will crush the Rebel presence on Tatooine in a series of decisive blows, and they will have nowhere to run.'

    dia_cha_11_tbft_e_7_intro2 "Intelligence section has identified it as a possible source of reinforcements to the Tatooine forces. I won't allow that."
    dia_cha_11_tbft_e_7_outro1 "Such wasted potential, Commander. I see you've chosen to side with tyrants and killers instead of helping to free the galaxy."
    dia_cha_11_tbft_e_7_outro2 'We\'ve been expecting this attack, "Operative". Bring everything you\'ve got. You\'ll need it, because the Rebel Alliance won\'t go down without a fight.'
    dia_cha_11_tbft_e_8_intro1 'Intelligence section has identified three primary Rebel fortresses. You will destroy them all in rapid succession and crush the traitors before they know what hit them.'

    dia_cha_11_tbft_r_10_tip1 'Enough! I will not be defeated! The time has come for you to face defeat, Rebel scum! You shall be ground beneath the heels of my [F2D62F]Elite AT-AT[-]!'
    dia_cha_11_tbft_r_11_intro1 "Agent, I can't thank you and Saponza enough for all you have done for the Rebel Alliance. Tatooine is free of the Empire's oppressive forces, because of you."

    dia_cha_11_tbft_r_1_outro1 "Good work, Agent. Have I told you that I used to be a moisture farmer? It's true. Then, one day the Empire came searching for some droids."
    dia_cha_11_tbft_r_1_outro2 'When it was over, my family and my farm were gone, and all I had to hold on to was a desperate need for justice to be served. Now could be our chance to deliver it to the Empire.'
    dia_cha_11_tbft_r_2_intro1 'What we have here, Agent, is an attempt by Captain Kosh to secretly build a fleet of smuggling ships for his private black market operations.'
    dia_cha_11_tbft_r_2_intro2 "No doubt many of these shuttles were reported lost over the past months. Let's drop by and make sure those Imperial records are... accurate."
    dia_cha_11_tbft_r_2_outro1 "I see what we're doin' here, partner. If this Captain Kosh is as corrupt as I've heard, destroyin' his private smuggling operation will really get under his skin."
    dia_cha_11_tbft_r_2_outro2 "You are absolutely correct, Agent Saponza. And there is one more target we'll strike in order to provoke the response we want."

    dia_cha_11_tbft_r_5_outro1 "We did it, Agent! If my sources are correct, that was the last of Kosh's mobile forces. We can launch an attack on Fort Ironhand without fear of immediate reprisal."

    dia_cha_11_tbft_r_7_intro1 "Agent, take a look at this secret facility. Its only purpose is to provide reinforcements to Fort Ironhand, so let's start by eliminating any chance of that happening."
    dia_cha_11_tbft_r_7_intro2 "It cost several of my spies their lives to get me information on its existence. Don't let their sacrifices be in vain."
    dia_cha_11_tbft_r_7_outro1 'How did you learn of this secret facility?! No matter... Fort Ironhand stands ready to repel you and your insignificant Rebel troops.'
    dia_cha_11_tbft_r_8_intro1 'This is it, Agent. Fort Ironhand. Ever since we hit Fort Sunfire, Kosh has been hard at work fortifying this fortress.'
    dia_cha_11_tbft_r_8_intro2 "Our attack will be in three stages, each against one of the garrisons. Let's start here with the western garrison."

    dia_epDemo_p1c1_01 "Very righteous, I'm sure. Anyway, I recently... acquired some Data Fragments that I think you'll find very interesting."
    dia_epDemo_p1c1_02 "These droids will roll right up to a target, drop an explosive, and BOOM! Ha ha! I could waste these on some backwater mining operation, but something tells me you'll find them far more useful."
    dia_epDemo_p1c1_03 "I've sent some jobs your way. Finish them, and everyone walks away happy! Well, everyone who doesn't have to fight those droids."
    dia_epDemo_p1c2_00 'How’s it coming? I trust you are satisfied with the Supply Crates you’ve received so far.'
    dia_epDemo_p1c2_01 'Keep up the good work, my friend!'
    dia_epDemo_p1cf_00 'My friend, this is very exciting! I was already getting depressed thinking about these droids being used in some boring mining operation.'
    dia_epDemo_p1cf_01 'I should never have doubted you. In fact, I will happily pay you for any extra work you complete on this job!'
    dia_epDemo_p2c1_00_e 'Hello again, Operative! I was thinking, blasters are trusty in a fight, but nothing compares to scattering your enemies with a well-placed explosion!'
    dia_epDemo_p2c1_00_r 'Hello again, Agent! I was thinking, blasters are trusty in a fight, but nothing compares to scattering your enemies with a well-placed explosion!'
    dia_epDemo_p2c1_01 'I find myself with several more jobs that need doing. The pay is worth it, trust me!'
    dia_epDemo_p2c1_02 'These droids get up close, drop an explosive charge, it goes boom, your enemies wonder where it all went wrong. Perfect for someone in your line of work!'
    dia_epDemo_p2c2_00 "Good work so far, my friend! You keep it up, I'll keep providing Supply Crates."
    dia_epDemo_p2cf_00 "Job well done, my friend! You have earned your payment, as promised. If you're up for more, on top of that, I will pay for any extra work you do on this job!"
    dia_epDemo_p3c1_00 'Greetings, my friend! I have some good news and some bad news.'
    dia_epDemo_p3c1_01 "The good news is that I have a last set of jobs I need you to do, in exchange for generous payment. I'm already jealous of you just thinking about it!"
    dia_epDemo_p3c1_02 "The bad news is the Data Fragments that I'm offering as payment have started to attract notice. I don't mind a little bit of attention, but even Hondo Ohnaka has limits."
    dia_epDemo_p3c1_03 "Complete the jobs and the fragments for these destructive droids are yours! Time is short, my friend. You'd better get going!"

    dia_epNaval_p1c1_01_r 'I must keep the details a secret. Suffice to say, the mission is better served by your less... official association with the Alliance.'

    dia_epNaval_p1c1_02_r 'Complete the tasks you are assigned and I will see that you are compensated.'
    dia_epNaval_p1c1_03_e 'Succeed in your tasks and I will authorize your usage of certain resources within the fleet. I expect results, Operative.'
    dia_epNaval_p1c1_03_r "The fleet's resources are not unlimited, but I can offer certain benefits if you finish your part of the mission. Goodbye for now, Agent."

    dia_epNaval_p1cf_00_e 'My staff tell me you have completed the final task, Operative. You have served the Empire well, and I will call upon you again.'
    dia_epNaval_p1cf_00_r 'I see that my faith in your skills was not misplaced, Agent. Well done. You have done a service for the Alliance.'
    dia_epNaval_p1cf_01_e 'Until then, I see no reason to pause your assault on the rebellion. Continued success deserves further reward.'
    dia_epNaval_p1cf_01_r 'I will have need of you again soon. In the meantime, I am prepared to compensate you for further disruption of Imperial efforts.'
    dia_epNaval_p2c1_00_e 'Operative, your previous efforts proved valuable. I require your skills once more.'
    dia_epNaval_p2c1_00_r 'Agent, this is Admiral Ackbar. I have need of your skills once more.'
    dia_epNaval_p2c1_01_e "As before, the details need not concern you. Engage the enemy. Remind them of the Empire's might."
    dia_epNaval_p2c1_01_r 'I admit that I had some reservations about involving you before, but you have proven yourself.'
    dia_epNaval_p2c1_02_e 'I am dispatching you a set of tasks. Do your job and you shall be compensated.'
    dia_epNaval_p2c1_02_r 'While the details of the larger mission must remain a secret, know that your continued efforts will be rewarded.'
    dia_epNaval_p2c1_03_e 'You will be rewarded handsomely, only if you complete them all. The Empire does not recognize failure.'
    dia_epNaval_p2c1_03_r 'Just as before, I will share valuable fleet resources with you so long as you finish your part of the mission. Signing off, Agent.'
    dia_epNaval_p2c2_00_e 'Maintain your offensives, Operative. The Rebels appear to be feeling the sting.'
    dia_epNaval_p2c2_00_r 'Greetings, Agent. My scouts report several disruptions to Imperial supply lines in this system. This is good news for us all.'
    dia_epNaval_p2cf_00_e 'Satisfactory work, Operative. Your performance does you credit.'
    dia_epNaval_p2cf_00_r 'Agent, I must thank you. The mission is progressing better than I expected.'
    dia_epNaval_p2cf_01_e 'I have other matters to attend to. For the time being, my staff are cleared to monitor your efforts and reward any additional progress you make.'
    dia_epNaval_p2cf_01_r 'I must see to other matters, but in the meantime I have authorized additional rewards for any extra tasks you are able to complete.'
    dia_epNaval_p3c1_00_e 'Operative, we are entering the final phase of the mission. The Rebellion must be brought to heel.'
    dia_epNaval_p3c1_00_r 'Greetings, Agent. The mission is nearing its end. Of course, the Empire will stop at nothing to see it fail.'
    dia_epNaval_p3c1_01_e 'Secrecy is now of the utmost importance. Take pride in knowing you are part of a greater cause.'
    dia_epNaval_p3c1_01_r 'I cannot share any more information with you yet. Just know that your efforts are critical to our victory.'
    dia_epNaval_p3c1_02_e 'And of course, greatness is valued by the Empire. Continue to perform well, and you shall be rewarded.'
    dia_epNaval_p3c1_02_r 'Your faith enables the Alliance to survive, Agent, and we will return the favor wherever we can.'
    dia_epNaval_p3c1_03_e "I will only honor success. I've come to expect nothing less of you, Operative."
    dia_epNaval_p3c1_03_r 'Your success means success for us all. If you are able to complete these tasks, the fleet will reward you. Good luck, Agent.'
    dia_epNaval_p3c2_00_e 'Operative, we are closing in on our target. Do not allow victory to slip away.'
    dia_epNaval_p3c2_00_r 'Agent, your efforts remain critical to our mission. The Alliance depends on you.'
    dia_epNaval_p3cf_00_e 'Mission complete, Operative. A certain Rebel convoy has eluded our grasp for weeks. Your attacks gave my forces the distraction needed to outmaneuver and trap the convoy.'
    dia_epNaval_p3cf_00_r "We've done it, Agent. One of our convoys under Imperial threat has finally escaped, thanks to the distraction created by your offensives."
    dia_epNaval_p3cf_01_e 'It was carrying supplies vital to the Rebellion. Strike again before they recover you will be rewarded further. The Empire thanks for your service on this mission, Operative.'
    dia_epNaval_p3cf_01_r "You must understand, the convoy's very existence must be kept a secret. If you can, maintain your attacks. The Alliance will reward you."
    dia_epRedCupRedux_p1c1_00 'Anyway, I- hang on. Somebody’s calling us.'
    dia_epRedCup_p1c1_00 "(...who are you!? Are these the right transmission coordinates? Hrmph, doesn't matter. I work for a powerful syndicate that wishes to be discreet.)"
    dia_epRedCup_p1c1_01 "(The name's Therm Scissorpunch. My boss wants Coaxium, and you're gonna get it for us. Got some highly sought after Data Fragments as payment.)"
    dia_epRedCup_p1c1_02 'Those Data Fragments have popped up on the black market before, likely the very same ones Calrissian mentioned in those old holorecordings!'
    dia_epRedCup_p1c1_03 "Careful, partner. Coaxium trading is volatile, like a game of Corellian Spike. That said, I think it's worth the risk to see where this goes."
    dia_epRedCup_p1c1_04 "(Hello? Are you listening to me? I assume you have thought it over and we have a deal. I'll contact you later, don't let the syndicate down.)"
    dia_epRedCup_p1c1_05 "I have my doubts, but you better get to collecting that Coaxium just in case. In the meantime I'm gonna look into this Scissorpunch character. Good luck!"
    dia_epRedCup_p1c2_00 "(There you are. I'll remind you only once, deliver the Coaxium soon or you won't get your hands on these Data Fragments. Don't let the syndicate down.)"
    dia_epRedCup_p1c2_01 "Keep at it, partner. I'm still talking with my contacts about Therm. I'll fill you in later."
    dia_epRedCup_p1c3_00 'Great work, partner! Looks like we have enough Coaxium to hand-off to Therm Scissorpunch and this mysterious syndicate.'
    dia_epRedCup_p1c3_01 "(You almost kept me waiting too long, but a deal's a deal. Here's your reward. Got no new work for you, but if you send me more Coaxium I'll throw you a bonus.)"
    dia_epRedCup_p2c1_00 "(How's my favorite Coaxium collector? Don't answer that because I don't care. You want more Data Fragments?)"
    dia_epRedCup_p2c1_01 "(We'll make you the same deal as last time: your Coaxium for my Data Fragments. I need to get rid of them, so get it done.)"
    dia_epRedCup_p2c1_02 "Hey, partner. A few of my contacts have been shedding light on Therm Scissorpunch's shadowy underworld connections, and guess what? They haven't found anything yet!"
    dia_epRedCup_p2c1_03 "Therm's trying to offload these Data Fragments in a hurry, so the merchandise might be stolen."
    dia_epRedCup_p2c1_04 "If we don't know where they came from, or who Therm is actually working for, it could be bad news for all of us."
    dia_epRedCup_p2c1_05 "Not bad enough that we don't take the job, but we should keep our guard up."
    dia_epRedCup_p2c2_00 '(What is taking you so long?! Do you not want these Data Fragments?! Is that it?! That must be it. Get me the Coaxium or else!)'
    dia_epRedCup_p2c2_01 "Hey, partner. Looks like Therm's desperation is showing. Keep it up, we'll have enough soon."
    dia_epRedCup_p2c3_00 "Alright, partner! Looks like we've got the Coaxium shipment all ready to go. Therm better be thankful for this."
    dia_epRedCup_p2c3_01 "(Well, despite your delay this will do quite nicely. Now take these Data Fragments off my claws. If you happen to get more Coaxium, I'm sure we can pay you for it.)"
    dia_epRedCup_p3c1_00 "(Ready to make a new deal? Got to make this quick but I've gotten hold of some tech I think you'd appreciate.)"
    dia_epRedCup_p3c1_01 "(If you get me enough Coaxium I'd be willing to part with it, but I have to move this fast, so hurry up!)"
    dia_epRedCup_p3c1_02 "What's the rush, Therm? Certainly your syndicate can get tech like this and sell it whenever they want, right?"
    dia_epRedCup_p3c1_03 "(Tech this rare doesn't just show up for just anyone to buy! I have a talent for acquiring goods, if you haven't noticed!)"
    dia_epRedCup_p3c1_04 'Quite a "talent" indeed. I\'m sure your boss is very pleased with your work.'
    dia_epRedCup_p3c1_05 "(...I don't know what you're insinuating, but I don't like it. Just get me the Coaxium so we can do business.)"
    dia_epRedCup_p3c1_06 "Hey, partner. I've got a lead on what Therm's up to, but I need time to chase it down. I'd take Therm's deal, but sleep with one eye open."
    dia_epRedCup_p3c2_00 "(Remember what's on offer here. This valuable tech once you get me the Coaxium I requested.)"
    dia_epRedCup_p3c2_01 'The Coaxium for "your syndicate" is almost ready to be shipped, Therm.'
    dia_epRedCup_p3c3_00 "Alright, Therm. We're ready to make the trade. Where should we send it again?"
    dia_epRedCup_p3c3_01 "(Excellent! The coordinates from our previous transaction will be fine. Enjoy your new toy. Oh, and if you have more Coaxium, I'll pay a premium for it.)"
    dia_epRedCup_p4c1_00 "Hey, Therm. The coordinates we've been using look an awful lot like the ones for your home. Is that how a secret syndicate does things, out in the open like that?"
    dia_epRedCup_p4c1_01 "(...my home coordinates? Hrmph. Okay, fine. I've been trading some items I found with you to make a quick profit. Alone. Just me. There's no boss.)"
    dia_epRedCup_p4c1_02 '(Unless you count these shady characters I lost to in an unlucky game of sabacc as my boss? I owe them Coaxium. A lot of Coaxium.)'
    dia_epRedCup_p4c1_03 "(The terms were fair: Get the Coaxium, or they'd boil me alive. I didn't know where to get that much Coaxium. But my luck changed when our transmissions crossed.)"
    dia_epRedCup_p4c1_04 '(You looked like someone who could get the job done. So I lied about who I worked for to get you to go along with it, so what!? You got paid.)'
    dia_epRedCup_p4c1_05 "Wait a second, Therm. You just happened to find all this loot? You didn't steal it?"
    dia_epRedCup_p4c1_06 '(So there I was coasting through the Halthor sector, and suddenly there was a big thud on the hull of my ship! Thought I was under attack!)'
    dia_epRedCup_p4c1_07 "(Turns out it was these containers full of old tech. Thought instead of the usual channels, I'd look for an antiquities buyer. Get a premium, ya know?)"
    dia_epRedCup_p4c1_08 "(But then I found you. I'm just glad you like old junk.)"
    dia_epRedCup_p4c1_09 "You have no idea! We'll get you the rest of the Coaxium for the rest of the tech you have, just hang tight!"
    dia_epRedCup_p4c2_00 'Take a listen to those old holorecordings again, partner.'
    dia_epRedCup_p4c2_01 '"...walkers ...in Halthor sector... shipment was blown out to space..."'
    dia_epRedCup_p4c2_02 "Somehow Therm found that lost cargo! We just need to get this last bit of Coaxium before he realizes what he's got and ups his price. We're almost there!"
    dia_epRedCup_p4c3_00 "(I knew when I mistakenly contacted you that you'd be somewhat useful to me. Here's the rest of the cargo you wanted.)"
    dia_epRedCup_p4c3_01 "(If you've got more Coaxium I have the credits to trade. Until then, I'm feeling lucky, so I think I'll stop at the casino on my way to pay off my debt. Ha ha!)"
    dia_epRogue1_p1c1_00 "Hey, partner. Kada Jahr has a job offer for us. I don't know how she got it, but she's offering to pay with some heavy-duty tech."
    dia_epRogue1_p1c1_01 "You worry too much, Saponza. It's from a freighter that left Imperial space some time ago but was crippled by some accident."
    dia_epRogue1_p1c1_02 "A scavenger crew found it and recovered these crates, which is what I plan to pay you if you can complete the jobs I've sent over."
    dia_epRogue1_p1c1_03_e "Operative, there's some heavy duty tech to be earned here. You don't want to miss out on this!"
    dia_epRogue1_p1c1_03_r "There's some heavy duty tech to be earned here, Agent. Don't miss out!"
    dia_epRogue1_p1c2_00_e "How's progress, Operative? I can't hold these goods forever, but I guarantee payment if you complete these jobs on time."
    dia_epRogue1_p1c2_00_r "How's progress, Agent? I can't hold these goods forever, but I guarantee payment if you complete these jobs on time."
    dia_epRogue1_p1cf_00 "Nice work. Here's your payment, as promised. The scavengers scored a major haul and I'll have more work for you soon."
    dia_epRogue1_p1cf_01 "For now, if you do extra work, I'll send over extra crates."
    dia_epRogue1_p2c1_00_e 'Hello again, Operative. I have another job for you, and more Data Fragments from that freighter cargo to back it up.'
    dia_epRogue1_p2c1_00_r 'Hello again, Agent. I have another job for you, and more Data Fragments from that freighter cargo to back it up.'
    dia_epRogue1_p2c1_01 'Seems there was an explosion on board some time after takeoff. It killed the whole crew and pushed the ship out of hyperspace.'
    dia_epRogue1_p2c1_02 "It was dumb luck the scavengers found it before anyone else. It won't stay secret forever, but we can both benefit from these recovered crates in the meantime."
    dia_epRogue1_p2c1_03 "Finish the job and I'll pay you well."
    dia_epRogue1_p2c2_00 "I'm keeping an eye on the scavengers. Nobody has let word of the freighter cargo slip- yet. You know how junker crews can be."
    dia_epRogue1_p2cf_00_e "I knew you'd come through, Operative. Can't say the same for the scavengers. Rumors about the cargo are starting to go around."
    dia_epRogue1_p2cf_00_r "I knew you'd come through, Agent. Can't say the same for the scavengers. Rumors about the cargo are starting to go around."
    dia_epRogue1_p2cf_01 "There's still time, though. I'll have more work for you soon, and extra crates for any more work you do on this current job."
    dia_epRogue1_p3c1_00_e 'I have some interesting news, Operative. It seems the freighter was sabotaged, likely an inside job that clearly went wrong.'
    dia_epRogue1_p3c1_00_r 'I have some interesting news, Agent. It seems the freighter was sabotaged, likely an inside job that clearly went wrong.'
    dia_epRogue1_p3c1_01 "I expect a rumor like that to get the Imperial Security Bureau's attention. Fortunately, there's still time for us to make a deal."
    dia_epRogue1_p3c1_02 'I have some of the best crates set aside for you- if you finish this new job in time.'
    dia_epRogue1_p3c1_03 "Dealing in stolen goods is always risky, but I think you'll agree that it's worth it."
    dia_epRogue1_p3c2_00_e "I hope you're holding up your end of things, Operative. ISB has just started asking questions, but I wouldn't waste time finishing this job."
    dia_epRogue1_p3c2_00_r "I hope you're holding up your end of things, Agent. ISB has just started asking questions, but I wouldn't waste time finishing this job."
    dia_epRogue1_p3cf_00_e "You've been busy, Operative. I'm sending payment, as promised. ISB has been busy, too, so I'll have one final job for you soon before I lay low."
    dia_epRogue1_p3cf_00_r "You've been busy, Agent. I'm sending payment, as promised. ISB has been busy, too, so I'll have one final job for you soon before I lay low."
    dia_epRogue1_p3cf_01 'In the meantime, I will pay extra for further work you put in to this job.'
    dia_epRogue1_p4c1_00_e "I have one last job for you, Operative, then I'm burning the rest of the freighter cargo. Don't worry, I'll scrub anything linking either of us back to it."
    dia_epRogue1_p4c1_00_r "I have one last job for you, Agent, then I'm burning the rest of the freighter cargo. Don't worry, I'll scrub anything linking either of us back to it."
    dia_epRogue1_p4c1_01 "The Imperial Security Bureau confirmed sabotage on the freighter. Obviously, they aren't very happy about it."
    dia_epRogue1_p4c1_02 "Fortunately, there's enough time for both of us to profit a little more. Finish the job, get your crates. Simple."
    dia_epRogue1_p4c1_03_e "I was going to keep these Data Fragments, but they're yours if you can deliver. Good luck, Operative."
    dia_epRogue1_p4c1_03_r "I was going to keep these Data Fragments, but they're yours if you can deliver. Good luck, Agent."
    dia_epRogue1_p4c2_00_e "I hope you're not falling behind, Operative. ISB's methods are crude, but effective. Don't overestimate how much time you left."
    dia_epRogue1_p4c2_00_r "I hope you're not falling behind, Agent. ISB's methods are crude, but effective. Don't overestimate how much time you left."
    dia_epRogue1_p4cf_00_e "Time's up soon, Operative. The Imperial Security Bureau will discover that someone took the freighter cargo, but never who."
    dia_epRogue1_p4cf_00_r "Time's up soon, Agent. The Imperial Security Bureau will discover that someone took the freighter cargo, but never who."
    dia_epRogue1_p4cf_01_r "I wish we'd been able to make more of this deal, but I have just enough crates left to pay you for any final work on this job. See you later."
    dia_epSpaceBear_w2c1_00 'Hey, partner. My contact seems to have taken a liking to your work. He offered a new set of jobs for us to do, with payment of course!'
    dia_epSpaceBear_w2c1_01_e "I think it's a good chance for us to help the Empire. We should start on this now so we can get our hands on that new military tech."
    dia_epSpaceBear_w2c1_01_r "I think it's a good chance for us to help the Alliance. We should start on this fast so we can get our hands on that new tech."
    dia_epSpaceBear_w2c2_00 "Keep up the good work, partner. My contact seems impressed. That's saying something!"
    dia_epSpaceBear_w2cf_00 "Nice work, partner! Looks like you got the payment our contact promised, and they'll compensate any extra work on this job. Keep going if you're ready for more!"
    dia_epSpaceBear_w3c1_00 "Hey, partner. There's somebody here you should meet."
    dia_epSpaceBear_w3c1_01 'Hello my friend! I am Hondo Ohnaka, infamous pirate and businessman. I have been watching your work and I must say, you have impressed me.'
    dia_epSpaceBear_w3c1_02 'This is no small feat, so congratulations. I have spoken with our friend Saponza and I think there is a bright, profitable future for us all!'
    dia_epSpaceBear_w3c1_03_e 'I will have important jobs from time to time, jobs that I will pay you for completing. You want to support your Empire, and how better to do so than be handsomely compensated?'
    dia_epSpaceBear_w3c1_03_r 'I will have important jobs from time to time, jobs that I will pay you for completing. You want to support your Alliance, and how better to do so than be handsomely compensated?'
    dia_epSpaceBear_w3c2_00 'Hello, Commander! I trust everything is going well and you are enjoying the Supply Crates I have provided so far.'
    dia_epSpaceBear_w3c2_01 'Complete this job and you will receive the complete payment, as promised. I always keep my word when there is profit involved!'
    dia_epSpaceBear_w3cf_00 "Very good, Commander! I see that doing business with you was a wise decision on my part, as usual. There's still some work left to do. What do you say?"
    dia_epSpaceBear_w4c1_00 'My friend! I have need of your services once again. A few days ago, one of my old crew went missing. A very odd occurrence.'
    dia_epSpaceBear_w4c1_01 'I need you to investigate what has happened to him. Per our usual terms, you will be paid.'
    dia_epSpaceBear_w4c1_02 "I don't expect it will be easy, but I do believe we both stand to benefit from what I have to offer you."
    dia_epSpaceBear_w4c2_00 "Hello, Commander! Thanks to your poking around, I know that my old crew member is alive. That's the good news."
    dia_epSpaceBear_w4c2_01 'The bad news is that he was kidnapped and is being held for ransom. Hondo Ohnaka does not pay ransomers. Can you imagine the damage to my reputation?'
    dia_epSpaceBear_w4c2_02 "But you can help me! I have lined up several jobs for you that will also disrupt the kidnappers' operations. While they are distracted, I will see to this... situation."
    dia_epSpaceBear_w4cf_00 'Thank you, my friend! Because of your efforts, the kidnappers realized the wisdom in releasing my friend.'
    dia_epSpaceBear_w4cf_01 'I trust that the payment is enough to keep my involvement our secret. Meanwhile, there is still work to be done before my next venture, Commander, and you know that I pay well!'
    dia_epSpaceBear_w5c1_00 'Commander, how are you? Our business arrangements have worked out so far, yes. I always pay fairly - and who could doubt this handsome face?'
    dia_epSpaceBear_w5c1_01_e "I will get to the point: your Imperial friends have picked up a spy. Normally I wouldn't care, but lucky for both of us, there is profit to be had in exposing this informer."
    dia_epSpaceBear_w5c1_01_r "I will get to the point: your Alliance friends have picked up a spy. Normally I wouldn't care, but lucky for both of us, there is profit to be had in exposing this informer."
    dia_epSpaceBear_w5c1_02 "The spy's identity is not so simple to obtain. I need to you to do some work for me first. Don't worry! Handsome face, fair pay, remember?"
    dia_epSpaceBear_w5c2_00 'The spy has been much quieter lately. Finding them will be difficult, but it means I have their scent!'
    dia_epSpaceBear_w5c2_01 "You keep up the good work, I'll keep up the hunt. Profit for both of us, my friend!"
    dia_epSpaceBear_w5cf_00_e 'Success, my friend! I am transmitting all the data that your Captain Kosh will need to catch this spy.'
    dia_epSpaceBear_w5cf_00_r 'Success, my friend! I am transmitting all the data that the Alliance will need to catch this spy.'
    dia_epSpaceBear_w5cf_01_e "You've got guts, Hondo, I'll give you that! What do you say, partner? Should we call up Kosh now?"
    dia_epSpaceBear_w5cf_01_r 'Hello, Agent. You wanted to speak with me?'
    dia_epSpaceBear_w5cf_02_e "What is it, Operative? I'm very busy."
    dia_epSpaceBear_w5cf_02_r 'A spy, you say? This is disturbing, indeed.'
    dia_epSpaceBear_w5cf_03_e "What's this? A spy? I will deal with this myself, and you will keep this information to yourself. Goodbye, Operative."
    dia_epSpaceBear_w5cf_03_r "I don't know where you got this information, and I'm not sure I want to. I'll look into this matter immediately. Thank you, Agent."
    dia_epSpaceBear_w5cf_04_e "I wish I could see this look on his face! Oh well, I have had enough of this already. If you haven't, I will pay for any extra work. Until next time, my friend."
    dia_epSpaceBear_w5cf_04_r "She is quite fierce! I would not want to be this spy. Oh well, I have had enough of this already. If you haven't, I will pay for any extra work. Until next time, my friend."
    dia_epSpaceBear_w6c1_00 'We meet again, my friend. I have some interesting news about our mutual associate, Saponza.'
    dia_epSpaceBear_w6c1_01 'I recently, ah... "acquired" some data pads in a deal. I was surprised to discover that early on, our dear friend Saponza worked up a considerable debt with with a syndicate.'
    dia_epSpaceBear_w6c1_02 "He's managed it fine so far, but it is never good to owe anything to criminals. They are not very nice people. Believe me, I should know!"
    dia_epSpaceBear_w6c1_03 "Anyway, I don't call just because I have a kind, gentle heart. Saponza has made me a lot of money over the years, and this debt to the syndicate threatens my business."
    dia_epSpaceBear_w6c1_04 'I have a plan to erase the debt without anything so boring as "repaying it." Do the jobs I send you and our friend will be free of the syndicate. I\'ll compensate you well, as usual.'
    dia_epSpaceBear_w6c1_05 "You help me pull this off, I'll have a big payment for you at the end. Everybody wins, yes?"
    dia_epSpaceBear_w6cf_00 "Hey partner. I know what you did for me. You really didn't have to, but... Thanks."
    dia_epSpaceBear_w6cf_01 "I know that old pirate Hondo was behind this, too! Well, I'm gonna upstage him for a change."
    dia_epSpaceBear_w6cf_02 "Any extra work you complete, I'll see to it you get rewarded. You tell Hondo the rest of this job is on me, partner!"
    dia_epSpacebear_w1c1_00 'Hey, partner. One of my old pirate contacts got in touch with me about some tech that’s just come on the market.'
    dia_epSpacebear_w1c1_01 'He says he’ll get us access in return for some work. He’s a real shady type, but his word is good when there’s profit involved.'
    dia_epSpacebear_w1c1_02 'There’s a limited time window for this job, so let’s get started. It’ll be worth it!'
    dia_epSpacebear_w1c2_00 'Doing great, partner. We make good on this deal, I bet there will be more jobs in the future.'
    dia_epSpacebear_w1cf_00 "You did it, partner! My contact came through, like I said. In fact, they told me they'll pay for any extra work we do on this contract. If you aren't satisfied, keep up the work and they'll keep up the payment!"
    dia_epUnderFire_p1c1_00_e 'Hello again, Friend! I was thinking, those Stormtroopers of yours are trusty in a fight, but what about something a little more out of the ordinary?'
    dia_epUnderFire_p1c1_00_r 'Hello again, Friend! I was thinking, those Soldiers of yours are trusty in a fight, but what about something a little more out of the ordinary?'
    dia_epUnderFire_p1c1_01 'I find myself with several more jobs that need doing. There are some truly extraordinary rewards in it for you, trust me!'
    dia_epUnderFire_p1c2_00 "Excellent! This relationship is most beneficial i'm sure you'll agree!"
    dia_epUnderFire_p1c2_01 "I'm positive you will want to help me with just a few more things, in exchange for more Crates of course!"
    dia_epUnderFire_p3cf_01 'I trust that the payment is enough to maintain our little business arrangement. Meanwhile, there is still work to be done before my next venture, Commander, and you know that I pay well!'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_0_intro1 "Operative, I have received new orders for you. These come from the top. Report to the planet [F2D62F]Er'Kit[-] immediately."
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_0_intro2 'Once you are there, you will be under the direct command of [F2D62F]Lord Vader[-] himself.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_10_intro1 "Darth Vader. I should have known. Hawk Company isn't going down without a fight. You hear me?!"
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_10_outro1 'Your days of treason against the Empire are over, mercenary. Now tell me... where is the [F2D62F]Jedi[-] hiding on this world?'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_10_outro2 "Jedi? Is that what you think is going on? You're in for a big surprise, ventilator face! Just you wait... ahhh... ugghhh... Can't. Breathe... Gahahh!"
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_10_outro3 'We will learn nothing useful from interrogating minions. We must uncover the true enemy on this world. Return to your base for now, Operative.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_11_intro1 'You got back just in the nick of time, Agent. An enormous Rebel force is bearing down on us.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_11_outro1 "Operative, Lord Vader has requested your presence. Return to Er'Kit immediately."
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_12_intro1 'I have tracked the last of the Hawk Company mercenaries to this town. Now we end this.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_12_intro2 'Send in the troops. Leave nothing standing.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_12_outro1 'And so, more traitors die screaming and unmourned. Curious, they appear to have been preparing a shipment. Investigate the destination coordinates at once.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_13_intro1 "[F2D62F]Rebels[-]. I am not surprised to find them on Er'Kit. Destroy them."
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_13_outro2 'This base has not yielded any useful information on Rebel positions. But if there is one base, there will be more. Find them.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_14_intro1 "Attack another [F2D62F]Rebel Operative[-] and see if they possess any useful information on Rebel forces on Er'Kit."
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_14_outro1 "It seems the Rebels have an extensive presence on Er'Kit after all. It is unlikely to be the base we are searching for. But it must still be dealt with."
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_14_outro2 "This may yet explain the echo I felt within the Force. Return to Er'Kit at once and continue the operation."
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_16_outro1 'I sense a shroud descending upon your base, Operative. You should return to it at once.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_17_intro1 'Incoming!'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_17_outro1 "That's not the last of them."
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_18_intro1 'Operative, a sizable Rebel force is inbound. You should be prepared to use starships on defense if necessary.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_18_outro1 "Good work, Operative. Return to Er'Kit and continue Lord Vader's mission."
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_1_intro1 "Your prompt arrival pleases me, Operative. This is Er'Kit. A seemingly insignificant world that holds its share of secrets."
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_1_intro2 'Your reputation for desert warfare is becoming quite well known. Do not fail me during our operations here.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_1_intro3 'Your first task will be to crush a paltry mercenary company with known ties to the Rebel Alliance. They are called the [F2D62F]Hawk Company[-]. Begin.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_1_outro1 'I approve of your methods, Operative. I see your reputation is well earned. The Hawk Company has many more such bases, and they must all be destroyed. Get to work.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_1_tip1 'I can deflect turret fire with my [F2D62F]lightsaber[-]. When your troops are in position, send the word, and we shall make this mercenary scum regret the day they ever dared to cross the Empire.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_20_intro1 "Operative, much of the Rebel forces on Er'Kit are deployed from this base."
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_20_intro2 'I have ordered a [F2D62F]Royal Guardsman[-] to assist us. They are excellent anti-infantry fighters.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_20_intro3 'Now get to work. We must destroy this staging ground and deny the Rebels any quarter.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_20_outro1 "With the destruction of this base, we have denied the Rebels a critical staging ground for their operations on Er'Kit."
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_20_outro2 'Now is the time to learn what the Rebels are doing here and stop it permanently. Continue attacking Rebel installations, Operative.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_22_outro1 'I will deal with this treasonous Rebel trash... personally. You WILL tell me what the Rebels are doing here on this planet.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_22_outro2 'No... no! Mercy! Mercy Please..... AHHHHHHH!'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_24_intro1 'I sense something important is hidden in this base. Operative, perform your duties.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_24_outro1 'According to these payment records, the Rebels hired the Hawk Company mercenaries to distract the Empire.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_24_outro2 'And references to an [F2D62F]"Operation Tsunami"[-]... the Rebels have grown bold. I will put an end to that.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_26_outro1 'This base housed a large-scale training operation. The Rebels are training a very sizable force on this planet.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_26_outro2 'Continue your work, Operative. We are beginning to see the true reason the Rebels are here.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_27_outro1 'Here are the files, Lord Vader. The Rebels were running a covert operation called "Operation Tsunami". It seems to have something to do with training infantry.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_27_outro2 'We will find the answers we seek, Operative. There are more Rebel bases left to crush.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_28_outro1 'Sir, "Operation Tsunami" appears to be a Rebel codename for a program to train a standing army to oppose the Empire.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_28_outro2 "According to their databanks, they were preparing to train tens of thousands of new soldiers here on Er'Kit."
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_28_outro3 'That will not happen. We will put an end to the Rebel presence on the planet once and for all. Then, we will find their main base and crush the Rebellion forever!'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_29_intro1 "This staging area must be crushed before we can begin the final assault on the primary Rebel base on Er'Kit."
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_29_intro2 'Sir, turret coverage is low. We should prepare for a strong counter attack from enemy troops.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_29_outro1 "Excellent. With the Rebels nearly defeated, we can begin our final assault on their primary base on Er'Kit."
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_2_intro1 'Another Hawk Company base. You know what to do.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_2_outro1 'I sense something hidden on this world. An echo in the [F2D62F]Force[-]. It is barely perceptible, yet it IS there.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_2_outro2 'There is more going on here than is immediately obvious, Operative. Continue your task. I will investigate.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_30_intro1 'This is the Rebel\'s primary base on Er\'Kit. Destroying it will shut down "Operation Tsunami", and all they will have is their paltry fleet.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_30_outro1 "Operative, you have done well, and I do not give praise lightly. The Rebel Alliance is in full retreat and their forces on Er'Kit are scattered and broken."
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_30_outro2 'I have done what I came here to do. Whatever else this world may hold is left to the local Moff. I have far more important tasks to attend to.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_30_outro3 'As for you, I may call upon you again. Until then, there are still Rebel bases to be crushed. Do not disappoint me.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_4_intro1 'According to my sources, the Hawk Company does not have many more bases.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_4_outro1 'Lord Vader, we uncovered a map during the battle. We have the coordinates of several more bases this mercenary company is using.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_4_outro2 'Very well. Operative, continue the purge.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_5_intro1 "Hey partner, I'm hearing a rumbling in the cantina. We're riling up those mercs real good on Er'Kit, and it seems they sent some troops to say hello."
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_5_outro1 "Every time I think I've seen the dumbest the galaxy has to offer, I get proven wrong. Attacking the Empire? These punks are fools."
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_5_outro2 "Head back to Er'Kit, partner. I'll deal with the cleanup."
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_6_intro1 'Your return is timely, Operative. This mercenary outpost must be crushed. See to it.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_6_outro1 "What I am searching for isn't here. Continue your mission. "
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_7_intro1 'The mercenaries do not have the necessary information I seek, it would seem. Locate a [F2D62F]Rebel Agent[-] and take the intel from their base.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_7_intro2 'And leave no survivors amongst that traitorous scum.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_7_outro1 "The [F2D62F]Rebels[-] are channeling supplies to Er'Kit via Nar'Shada. Intriguing. Something is happening on Er'Kit, Operative. We must return at once."
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_8_intro1 'Partner, the Rebels are attacking!'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_e_8_outro1 "You're sure stirring up a mynock's nest on Er'Kit. I wonder what's so important there?"
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_0_intro1 "Agent, I have received an urgent request from Rebel Command. Please head to the planet of [F2D62F]Er'Kit[-] with all due haste."
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_0_intro2 'There you will work with Commander [F2D62F]Luke Skywalker[-] and be at his aid for an important operation on that world.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_10_intro1 "So, Luke Skywalker is it? You and that Agent are the ones who've been attacking my bases! Malachor Company won't go down without a fight!"
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_10_outro1 "You're defeated. Tell me what you know. Who hired you to attack the people of Er'Kit?"
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_10_outro2 "I think you know... boy. They're going to have a few words with you real soon."
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_10_outro3 "That sounds ominous. You'd better check on your base. Head back at once, Agent. I'll lock these mercs up for now."
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_11_intro1 'You got back just in the nick of time, Agent. An enormous Imperial force is bearing down on us.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_11_outro1 "Agent, clearly the situation is growing more desperate on Er'Kit. Please rejoin Commander Skywalker and get to the bottom of this."
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_12_intro1 'Good to see you again, Agent. The last of the Malachor Company is holed up in this town.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_12_intro2 "I don't like it, but there's no choice but to send the troops in. Luckily the Er'Kit fled when the mercs came in, so it's just us and them. No civilians."
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_12_outro1 "That's the end of Malachor Company. Strange though, they were preparing to ship supplies somewhere. Let's see what's at these coordinates."
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_13_intro1 "[F2D62F]The Empire![-] They're on Er'Kit? This just keeps getting more interesting."
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_13_outro2 "This base didn't have any useful intel, but if there's one base, there's bound to be more."
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_14_intro1 "Attack another [F2D62F]Imperial Operative[-] and see if you can find any intelligence on the Empire's Er'Kit operation."
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_14_outro1 "If this is right... the Empire has an extensive presence on Er'Kit that they've managed to keep hidden really well."
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_14_outro2 "I knew the Empire had to be involved in this some way. I'll start checking around on Er'Kit for Imperial presence."
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_16_outro1 "I'm getting a distress call from your partner, Agent. you should head back to your base!"
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_17_intro1 'Incoming!'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_17_outro1 "That's not the last of them."
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_18_intro1 'Agent, you may wish to consider calling in starships  to aid in this defense. The enemy onslaught is quite heavy.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_18_outro1 "Things are heating up in the war, Agent. You'd better get back to Er'Kit."
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_1_intro1 "Greetings, you must be the talented Agent I've heard about. Welcome to Er'Kit, I'm Luke Skywalker."
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_1_intro2 'Your reputation for desert warfare precedes you, so I asked for your help with a special mission here.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_1_intro3 'The first thing we need to do is defeat a mercenary group called the [F2D62F]"Malachor Company"[-]. They\'ve been oppressing the local people. Let\'s get to work.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_1_outro1 "Great work, Agent. I see your reputation is well earned. The Malachor Company has several more bases here on Er'Kit. Let's keep at it, shall we?"
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_1_tip1 "See those turrets? I can deflect their shots with my [F2D62F]lightsaber[-]. When they're shooting at me, give the order and I'll deflect their shots so the troops can attack them."
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_20_intro1 "There you are. This place is where the Empire is deploying most of its troops from across Er'Kit. We need to stop that."
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_20_intro2 "But there's a lot of troops garrisoned here, so I called a friend for help. You already know [F2D62F]Princess Leia[-], right?"
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_20_intro3 "Good to see you again, Agent. Let's get to work."
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_20_outro1 "With this base defeated, we've dealt a huge blow to Imperial operations on Er'Kit, but we're no closer to knowing what it is they're doing here."
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_20_outro2 "There are still more Imperial facilities we can go after. We'd better keep at it while we can."
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_22_outro1 'Look at this... unsecured communications station.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_22_outro2 'Imperial Security Bureau... [F2D62F]Special Operations Division[-]? What is that? We will have to go after the other bases to find out anything more.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_24_intro1 'Look at this place... This base must be important.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_24_outro1 'I\'m looking through the logs now... Here! In the payment records. The Empire definitely hired the Malachor Company to "relocate" the native people.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_24_outro2 "References to something called [F2D62F]Project Hidden Eye[-], and three sets of coordinates. This can't be a coincidence."
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_26_outro1 "Not a lot to go on here... looks like the Empire is trying to create some kind of [F2D62F]sleeper operative[-] using cybernetics. I'm not a doctor though, so I'm not sure what to make of it."
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_26_outro2 "Let's see if the next base has any more clues."
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_27_outro1 "Hmm. More information in this base's database. It looks like they're trying to create sleeper operatives to spread throughout the galaxy."
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_27_outro2 'They would embed themselves within cities and report on /"sedition, treason, and matters of interest to the ISB/". Sounds bad.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_28_outro1 'It says... Oh no... This project is almost ready to send out the first wave of spies!'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_28_outro2 'The Empire\'s \\"Project Hidden Eye\\" is trying to seed them across the galaxy to spread propaganda and secretly report on citizens!'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_28_outro3 'This is evil. We have to stop it, Agent. Untold lives will be lost if these operatives are spread across the galaxy!'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_29_intro1 'Before we can take out the base, this \\"Project Hidden Eye\\" is being run from, we\'ll need to defeat this staging area. Otherwise, we will be counter-attacked.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_29_intro2 "I don't see many turrets. We should expect a strong resistance from Imperial troops and vehicles."
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_29_outro1 'Good. With that out of the way, we can head to the final base and put an end to this project once and for all.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_2_intro1 'Another Malachor Company base. You know what to do.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_2_outro1 'Rebel intelligence heard some strange things about the Malachor Company, and as soon as I got here to investigate I felt an... echo in the [F2D62F]Force[-].'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_2_outro2 "I don't quite know how to explain it, but there's more going on here on Er'Kit than meets the eye."
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_30_intro1 'This is it, Agent. If we destroy this base, we can stop this insidious evil before it is ever unleashed on an unsuspecting galaxy.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_30_outro1 'We stopped an evil from being released on the galaxy today, my friend. And in so doing, we saved countless lives.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_30_outro2 "But our mission on Er'Kit isn't yet complete; Rebel Command has a lot more for me to do here."
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_30_outro3 "I'm sure in time I will call on you again. Until then, keep attacking the Imperials on this planet... and may the Force be with you."
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_4_intro1 "Based on what I was told before departing for Er'Kit, I don't think the Malachor Company has that many bases left. Let's keep going."
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_4_outro1 'Sir, we found a map while we were combing through the rubble. We have the coordinates of several more bases this mercenary company is using.'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_4_outro2 "Good work, Sergeant. Let's go."
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_5_intro1 "Hey partner, I'm hearing a rumbling in the cantina. We're riling up those mercs real good on Er'Kit, and it seems they sent some troops to say hello."
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_5_outro1 "Punks. Upstart mercs have no respect these days. We're busy fighting for the freedom of the galaxy... Meanwhile, these guys want a piece of us too?"
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_5_outro2 "Head back to Er'Kit, partner. I'll deal with the cleanup here."
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_6_intro1 'Hey, welcome back. I was just about to attack this mercenary outpost with my squad. Lead us in, will ya?'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_6_outro1 "Something isn't adding up. There's more going on here on Er'Kit than meets the eye."
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_7_intro1 "I've got an idea. There's [F2D62F]Imperial Operatives[-] all over the sector. Why not attack one and steal some intel from their base?"
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_7_intro2 "That might give us some insight into what's happening on Er'Kit."
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_7_outro1 "I knew it! Look at this intel! Imperial supplies have been ferried to Er'kit through Nar'Shaddaa. Something big is happening on Er'kit. Let's get back there."
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_8_intro1 'Partner, the Empire is attacking!'
    dia_evt_4_eotf_r_8_outro1 "You're sure stirring up a mynock's nest on Er'Kit. I wonder what's so important there?"
    dia_evt_5_tbd_e_0_intro1 "Operative, we've lost contact with several bases on [F2D62F]Er'Kit[-]. Intelligence points to a single group of Thalassian slavers, but information is scarce."
    dia_evt_5_tbd_e_0_intro2 "Therefore, I am forced to involve our contact on Er'Kit, [F2D62F]Dyro Felldor[-]. He is a non-human, but Subsector Command has given no choice. Do not fail them."
    dia_evt_5_tbd_e_0_intro3 'Hello, Operative. The Thalassians have plagued our planet since before the Clone Wars and thrive under the Empire. But now they are our common enemy. We will assist you.'
    dia_evt_5_tbd_e_10_intro1 'Operative, I have reports of a strange signal coming from this base.'
    dia_evt_5_tbd_e_10_intro2 "This doesn't match the Thalassians known comms frequencies. It may be coming from a Hailfire droid. Be careful."
    dia_evt_5_tbd_e_12_intro1 "Operative, I have news. The Blood Dawn's discovery of the Hailfire droid army was not an accident. Someone may be giving them information."
    dia_evt_5_tbd_e_12_intro2 "Could that be why Lord Vader was so interested in Er'Kit? Most likely, the [F2D62F]Rebels[-] are using the Blood Dawn to strike at our forces. Attack a Rebel Agent to find out."
    dia_evt_5_tbd_e_12_outro1 "This data indicates that the Rebels have been attacked on Er'Kit as well. They are not a threat, for now."
    dia_evt_5_tbd_e_12_outro2 "Lucky for us. We don't want to be fighting the Rebels and the Blood Dawn at the same time."
    dia_evt_5_tbd_e_14_intro1 "Blood Dawn attack incoming. Whatever you're doing on Er'Kit, it must be working. They're rolling out Hailfire droids!"
    dia_evt_5_tbd_e_15_intro1 'The Blood Dawn seem to have learned from your previous use of starship strikes. This base is heavily shielded.'
    dia_evt_5_tbd_e_15_intro2 'The Empire is one step ahead, once again. Our [F2D62F]TIE Advanced starship strikes[-] are designed to take down shields.'
    dia_evt_5_tbd_e_15_outro1 'No base should put too much faith in shield generators. Deploy [F2D62F]TIE Advanced starship strikes[-] to soften up any shielded base.'
    dia_evt_5_tbd_e_16_outro1 'Adequate work, Operative. None of our remaining bases report any Blood Dawn attacks. Advance on the Blood Dawn before they have time to regroup.'
    dia_evt_5_tbd_e_17_outro1 'We have uncovered secret orders sent to the Blood Dawn. They contain the location the Hailfires you destroyed.'
    dia_evt_5_tbd_e_17_outro2 "Proof that the Blood Dawn are not acting alone. There's bound to be a trail of information leading back to their higher-ups."
    dia_evt_5_tbd_e_1_intro1 'It would seem the Thalassians have captured this base. We must assume that they have managed to turn your Imperial defenses against you.'
    dia_evt_5_tbd_e_1_intro2 'Very likely. Operative, any captured garrisons are no longer part of the Empire. Do not hesitate to destroy them.'
    dia_evt_5_tbd_e_1_outro1 "They captured the base? Doesn't sound like the Thalassians I've run into. They shouldn't have the firepower to take down one of ours, let alone capture it."
    dia_evt_5_tbd_e_1_outro2 'I agree. We are looking into this now. In the meantime, I suggest you regroup and head to the next base.'
    dia_evt_5_tbd_e_20_intro1 'We read a large number of vehicles closing on your garrison, Agent. The Blood Dawn seem desperate to test the Empire once more.'
    dia_evt_5_tbd_e_20_outro1 'The Blood Dawn are on the defensive, Operative. Subsector Command has provided the coordinates of their remaining bases. You are to deploy against them at once.'
    dia_evt_5_tbd_e_25_intro1 "You have kept your word to help us, Operative, so we have kept ours. Here is the Blood Dawn's central base, where most of their remaining Hailfire droids are massed."
    dia_evt_5_tbd_e_25_intro2 "You are entrusted to destroy it, and discover who truly commands the Blood Dawn. Show the Er'Kit what a proper military operation looks like."
    dia_evt_5_tbd_e_25_outro1 'Whomever controls the Blood Dawn remains a mystery, but no one hides from the Empire for long. Return to Tatooine for debriefing.'
    dia_evt_5_tbd_e_25_outro2 "You have destroyed a piece of Danry Ledwellow's bloody legacy. The Thalassian slavers persist, but the droid army is no more."
    dia_evt_5_tbd_e_25_outro3 "The Empire has been no great friend to the Er'Kit, but we are free of the Blood Dawn's threat. You have our respect, Operative."
    dia_evt_5_tbd_e_26_intro1 'The Blood Dawn are broken and scattered. Search for any more that may have escaped and destroy them. Kosh out.'
    dia_evt_5_tbd_e_2_intro1 'Subsector Command confirms that we are not dealing with ordinary Thalassians. They call themselves the [F2D62F]Blood Dawn[-], and they are unusually well armed.'
    dia_evt_5_tbd_e_2_intro2 "Huh, never heard of 'em."
    dia_evt_5_tbd_e_2_intro3 'Indeed. No one has. They surfaced only recently, and have ignored all of our attempts to make contact.'
    dia_evt_5_tbd_e_2_outro1 'Continue the assault, Operative. The Thalassians may operate on Er’Kit as long as they respect the rule of the Empire.'
    dia_evt_5_tbd_e_2_outro2 "The Blood Dawn's annihilation will be a testament to what happens when that respect is not paid."
    dia_evt_5_tbd_e_3_intro1 'The Blood Dawn are resourceful. The walls of this base have been augmented.'
    dia_evt_5_tbd_e_3_intro2 'This was foreseen, Operative. I have provided you a limited number of  [F2D62F]Shock Troopers[-]. They will break through the walls from a safe distance.'
    dia_evt_5_tbd_e_3_outro1 'I must admit, I am impressed. Your [F2D62F]Shock Troopers[-] will surely be useful in the future.'
    dia_evt_5_tbd_e_4_intro1 "Before the Clone Wars, Er'Kit Senator Danry Ledwellow was rumored to have an army of [F2D62F]Hailfire-class tank droids[-]. The Blood Dawn found the droids and used them to capture your bases."
    dia_evt_5_tbd_e_4_intro2 "Ledwellow? Wasn't he arrested for taking bribes from the Thalassians?"
    dia_evt_5_tbd_e_4_intro3 "Yes. Bribes to let the Thalassians run slaving operations on our planet. Ledwellow has caused Er'Kit much suffering. With his droids, the Blood Dawn will make the Empire suffer, too."
    dia_evt_5_tbd_e_4_intro4 'I have brought you to their vehicle yard. Destroy these [F2D62F]Hailfire droids[-] and the Blood Dawn will be forced to end their advances.'
    dia_evt_5_tbd_e_4_outro1 "Hey partner, I think you just hit a nerve with those Blood Dawn. We've got ships touching down nearby and they don't look friendly. You may want to get back here quickly."
    dia_evt_5_tbd_e_5_intro1 "We've got incoming hostiles, partner. I don't think the Blood Dawn is very happy with us."
    dia_evt_5_tbd_e_5_outro1 "The Er'Kit have clearly failed to communicate the nature of this threat. More Imperial garrisons on the planet have gone dark. Return there and show these aliens the proper way to deal with an enemy."
    dia_evt_5_tbd_e_8_intro1 "Operative, it seems the Rebels believe they can exploit the situation on Er'Kit by attacking us on Tatooine. Show them the error of their strategy."
    dia_evt_5_tbd_e_8_outro1 "A feeble attempt. Your mission is unchanged. Return to Er'Kit and remove the Blood Dawn from any more of our captured garrisons."
    dia_evt_5_tbd_e_9_intro1 'The Blood Dawn have changed strategy... perhaps after losing so many Hailfire droids to your forces. I am certain those [F2D62F]watchtowers[-] will be defended by [F2D62F]infantry[-].'
    dia_evt_5_tbd_e_9_intro2 'No matter. We have outfitted several [F2D62F]VT-49 Decimator starships[-] to drop firebombs, effective against infantry. I expect results, Operative.'
    dia_evt_5_tbd_e_9_outro1 '[F2D62F]VT-49 Decimator starship strikes[-] inflict heavy damage to infantry, as well as HQs.'
    dia_evt_5_tbd_r_0_intro1 "Agent, we've lost contact with several bases on [F2D62F]Er'Kit[-]. We know that a single group of Thalassian slavers is responsible, but not much else."
    dia_evt_5_tbd_r_0_intro2 "We need a scout and you are the most qualified. To assist, I'm putting you in touch with our contact on Er'Kit, [F2D62F]Dyro Felldor[-]"
    dia_evt_5_tbd_r_0_intro3 'Greetings, Agent. The Thalassians have plagued our planet since before the Clone Wars, but now they are our common enemy. We will assist you however we can.'
    dia_evt_5_tbd_r_10_intro1 'Agent, we have just intercepted a strange signal coming from this base.'
    dia_evt_5_tbd_r_10_intro2 "This doesn't match the Thalassians known comms frequencies. It may be coming from a Hailfire droid. Be careful."
    dia_evt_5_tbd_r_12_intro1 "Agent, I have news. We now believe the Blood Dawn's discovery of the Hailfire droid army was not an accident. Someone may be giving them information."
    dia_evt_5_tbd_r_12_intro2 "Could that have been what Skywalker was investigating on Er'Kit? The Blood Dawn may have been fed information by the Empire. Attack an Imperial Operative to find out."
    dia_evt_5_tbd_r_12_outro1 "If the Empire is behind the Blood Dawn, they've kept it deeply secret. This data indicates that the Empire has also been attacked on Er'Kit."
    dia_evt_5_tbd_r_12_outro2 "Lucky for us. We don't want to be fighting the Empire and the Blood Dawn at the same time."
    dia_evt_5_tbd_r_14_intro1 "Blood Dawn attack incoming. Whatever you're doing on Er'Kit, it must be working. They're rolling out Hailfire droids!"
    dia_evt_5_tbd_r_15_intro1 'The Blood Dawn seem to have learned from your previous use of starship strikes. This base is heavily shielded.'
    dia_evt_5_tbd_r_15_intro2 'A tactical mistake. Our [F2D62F]A-wing starship strikes[-] are designed to take down shields.'
    dia_evt_5_tbd_r_15_outro1 'Overconfidence in shield generators is a weakness. Deploy [F2D62F]A-wing starship strikes[-] to soften up any shielded base.'
    dia_evt_5_tbd_r_16_outro1 "You are doing well, Agent. The situation on Er'Kit has stabilized. Now press the advantage and take the fight to the Blood Dawn."
    dia_evt_5_tbd_r_17_outro1 'We have uncovered secret orders sent to the Blood Dawn. They contain the location of the Hailfires you destroyed.'
    dia_evt_5_tbd_r_17_outro2 "So the Blood Dawn are not acting alone. There's bound to be a trail of information leading back to whoever is controlling them."
    dia_evt_5_tbd_r_1_intro1 "It would seem the Thalassians have captured this base. We must assume that they've managed to turn your Rebel defenses against you, as well."
    dia_evt_5_tbd_r_1_intro2 'Yes, I would do the same in that situation. You are cleared to engage any captured bases, Agent. Be careful.'
    dia_evt_5_tbd_r_1_outro1 "They captured the base? Doesn't sound like the Thalassians I've run into. They shouldn't have the firepower to take down one of ours, let alone capture it."
    dia_evt_5_tbd_r_1_outro2 'I agree. We are looking into this now. In the meantime, I suggest you regroup and head to the next base.'
    dia_evt_5_tbd_r_20_intro1 "We're reading a large number of vehicles closing on our base, Agent. The Blood Dawn is desperate to end this now. Get ready."
    dia_evt_5_tbd_r_20_outro1 "Now the real fight begins. Capturing our bases on Er'Kit has given the Blood Dawn plenty of time to establish their own. Your orders are to remove this threat."
    dia_evt_5_tbd_r_25_intro1 "It took some time, but we have located the Blood Dawn's central base. Most of their remaining forces are massed here, including many Hailfire droids."
    dia_evt_5_tbd_r_25_intro2 'Our priority is destruction of their forces, but find out who has been controlling the Blood Dawn if you can. Use any means at your disposal. The Alliance is counting on you.'
    dia_evt_5_tbd_r_25_outro1 "Well done, Agent. Data found at the base doesn't indicate who is behind the Blood Dawn, but we will find them. You've defended the Alliance, and protected Er'Kit from a grave threat."
    dia_evt_5_tbd_r_25_outro2 "And thanks to you, a piece of Danry Ledwellow's bloody legacy is gone. The Thalassian slavers persist, but the droid army is no more. Er'Kit thanks you."
    dia_evt_5_tbd_r_26_intro1 'The Blood Dawn are broken and scattered. Search for any more  that may have escaped and wipe them out. The Alliance is counting on you.'
    dia_evt_5_tbd_r_2_intro1 'Our sources confirm that we are not dealing with ordinary Thalassians. This group calls themselves the [F2D62F]Blood Dawn[-], and they are unusually well armed.'
    dia_evt_5_tbd_r_2_intro2 "Huh, never heard of 'em."
    dia_evt_5_tbd_r_2_intro3 'Indeed. No one has. They surfaced only recently, and have ignored all of our attempts to make contact. If you cannot negotiate for your captured bases, you must reclaim them by force.'
    dia_evt_5_tbd_r_2_outro1 "Continue your assault, Agent. The Blood Dawn is a grave threat to the Alliance, as well as the Er'Kit people."
    dia_evt_5_tbd_r_3_intro1 'The Blood Dawn are resourceful. The walls of this base have been augmented.'
    dia_evt_5_tbd_r_3_intro2 'I can help you there, Agent. Use these [F2D62F]Vanguard Troopers[-] to punch through the walls from a safe distance.'
    dia_evt_5_tbd_r_3_outro1 'An impressive display. Your [F2D62F]Vanguard Troopers[-] will surely be useful in the future.'
    dia_evt_5_tbd_r_4_intro1 "Before the Clone Wars, Er'Kit Senator Danry Ledwellow was rumored to have an army of [F2D62F]Hailfire-class tank droids[-]. The Blood Dawn found the droids and used them to capture your bases."
    dia_evt_5_tbd_r_4_intro2 "Ledwellow? Wasn't he arrested for taking bribes from the Thalassians?"
    dia_evt_5_tbd_r_4_intro3 "Yes. Bribes to let the Thalassians run slaving operations on our planet. Ledwellow has caused Er'Kit much suffering. With his droids, the Blood Dawn will make the Alliance suffer, too."

    dia_evt_5_tbd_r_5_intro1 "We've got incoming hostiles, partner. I don't think the Blood Dawn is very happy with us."
    dia_evt_5_tbd_r_5_outro1 "The Blood Dawn clearly have more droids than the Er'Kit know about. More of our bases on the planet have gone dark. Return to Er'Kit and continue rooting them out."
    dia_evt_5_tbd_r_8_intro1 'Agent, it seems the Empire is attempting to take advantage of our predicament. Prepare for an attack!'
    dia_evt_5_tbd_r_8_outro1 "Even with the Empire at our door, we can't let up. Keep the pressure on the Blood Dawn or Er'Kit may be lost."
    dia_evt_5_tbd_r_9_intro1 'The Blood Dawn have changed strategy... perhaps after losing so many Hailfire droids to your forces. I am certain those [F2D62F]watchtowers[-] will be defended by [F2D62F]infantry[-].'
    dia_evt_5_tbd_r_9_intro2 'We have outfitted several [F2D62F]HWK-290 starships[-] to drop incendiary bombs, effective against infantry. Use them wisely.'
    dia_evt_5_tbd_r_9_outro1 '[F2D62F]HWK-290 starship strikes[-] inflict heavy damage to infantry, as well as HQs.'
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_0_intro1 'Hey partner, I\'m hearing some odd things in the cantina. We\'d best be prepared to make some new "friends".'
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_10_fail1 'If an enemy attack seems too powerful, ensure the base is well defended with strategically placed turrets, shield generators, walls, and traps.'
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_10_outro1 'Operative, we are working to decrypt the captured Rebel intelligence. In the meantime, we have identified some Rebel installations. Deal with them.'
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_13_outro1 "We have broken the encryption on the Rebel data. I'm sending you some coordinates on Er'Kit. Investigate immediately."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_14_intro1 "Partner, according to Kosh this base belongs to the Er'Kit militia that attacked us. They're being armed by the Rebels. Let's get to it."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_14_outro1 "Ahh, Operative. Good to see you again. You remember me, I trust? I see you've become acquainted with the local troublemakers."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_14_outro2 "With the defeat of the Blood Dawn, there was something of a... power vacuum here on Er'Kit. This group decided to side with the Rebel Alliance."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_14_outro3 "A most unfortunate turn of events. It seems whomever they are working for is trying to seize power over Er'Kit."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_15_intro1 "The decrypted coordinates have also led us to this base. If we're lucky, taking it out will stop the attacks on us."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_15_outro1 "I'm afraid I really must insist you stop your activities on Er'Kit. We are grateful for your help with the Blood Dawn, but this is an internal matter."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_15_outro2 'Internal matter my ass! They attacked us, Dyro. Myaybe you should handle your "internal matters" before they show up on our front door?'
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_16_intro1 "I suppose it's come to this then. I had hoped we could keep my true allegiances in the dark, but you've forced my hand by attacking my bases."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_16_intro2 "For what it's worth, I'm grateful for your elimination of the Blood Dawn. They were all that stood in my way. Now it's just you."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_16_outro1 "Dyro... is working with the Rebels? That's not good."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_16_outro2 "We cannot let Er'Kit join the Rebels, Operative. We require additional intel. The kind of Intel standard channels may not provide."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_16_outro3 "Contact Senator Kessen. We freed him for his extensive underworld connections. It's time we used them."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_17_int1 'Ha ha! Wow, look at it burn. What is that made out of? Explosives?'
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_17_int2 "No! That one had sentimental value! You'll regret that, Johhar Kessen!"
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_17_intro1 'Operative, this place is run by a bird named Liana. She escaped an Imperial prison transport and has been making a living selling "like new" weapons.'
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_17_intro2 "And I hear she recently sold some of those weapons to our friend Dyro on Er'Kit. Why don't we drop in for a visit?"
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_17_intro3 "I've got two new kinds of hirelings with me: the Chiss ladies will shoot whatever is closest, and the Jawas will dismantle any shield generators."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_17_mid1 'Damn you, Kessen! That one was in mint condition! Do you even know how hard it is to steal those from the Empire?'
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_17_mid2 "Well, tell me what I want to know darlin' and I'll stop blowing up your stuff."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_17_outro1 "Okay darlin'... Look, you're running out of things for me to destroy. Tell me about the your shipment to Er'kit already."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_17_outro2 "Fine. Just take the info and leave. But know this: I'll get you back for this, Kessen. Some day, somehow. You'll pay."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_17_outro3 "Why Liana Kor, do I detect a hint of anger in your hologram? I'm shocked! Operative, we'd best get out of here."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_17_tip1 'Oh, wow. That looked expensive. Sorry about that one, Kor.'
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_17_tip2 "You'll pay for that, Kessen!"
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_18_intro1 "According to the manifests, all of Liana's weapons were sent to this location. Looks like some kind of shipment facility."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_18_outro1 "I've gone over the shipping logs. The Rebels were definitely using Liana's operation to funnel weapons and supplies to Dyro's little militia."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_18_outro2 "I've got coordinates for several more facilities here on Er'Kit. Let's take them offline for good."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_19_intro1 'This would appear to be where the Rebels are storing all of its weapon shipments for distribution. I trust you know what to do, Operative.'
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_19_outro1 "Operative, once again I see you can't leave well enough alone. For the first time in a generation, Er'Kit has stability."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_19_outro2 'And what do you do? Come in, guns blazing, disrupting my new alliance with the Rebels!'
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_1_intro1 "Man the defenses! We're under attack!"
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_1_outro2 "Er'Kit... commandos? Since when do the Er'Kit have a military force?"
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_1_outro3 "Even more troublesome, Operative: These Er'Kit were armed with [F2D62F]Rebel[-] infantry weapons. Trace them back to their landing zone immediately."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_20_intro1 "This was to be the place the Rebels would instruct my recruits, in the first Er'Kit militia training ground."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_20_intro2 "And you're ruining it."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_20_outro1 "Can that really be the same guy who helped us against the Blood Dawn? I can't believe it was just a plot for him to seize power."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_20_outro2 "His plans are irrelevant, Operative. Er'Kit will never be allowed to join the Rebels. Continue your work to pacify this world."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_21_intro1 'Yes! The time has come to put those Rebel weapons and training to use. Attack!'
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_21_intro2 "Operative, I do hope you're not getting attached to this base. Because my troops are about to destroy it."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_21_outro1 "A desperate act by a fool. Pay no heed to this non-human scum, Operative. Return to Er'Kit and finish this."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_22_intro1 "And here you are again. You're getting predictable, Operative."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_22_intro2 "So you're the Imperial Operative we've heard so much about. I'm sorry but your campaign against the free people of Er'Kit must be stopped."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_22_outro1 "I've seen that gal before somewhere. She must be the Rebel liaison Dyro is working with."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_22_outro3 'Operative, we have a plan to lure out the defenders of the final Rebel base. Contact Senator Kessen, he will explain the details'
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_23_intro1 "This Rebel base is a whopper. I'm going to help you draw it's defenders away with a ruse."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_23_intro2 "I've also managed to round up a few thieves who will do a number on resources, and some old refurbished tanks. Let's get to it."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_23_outro1 "Okay, that does it. Let's get out of here. The entire remainder of the planetary forces will be here any minute."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_23_outro2 "Have fun storming the castle, Operative. I'll see you around."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_23_tip1 "Okay, I'm tapped into their comms array. I'm going to spoof a distress call, watch this..."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_23_tip2 "Command, this is outpost, er... 23! We're under attack by a bunch of inexpensive cannon fodder and a devilishly handsome rogue!"
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_23_tip3 'Copy, outpost 23. Reinforcements are inbound to your location.'
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_24_intro1 "Operative, this is the final base on Er'kit, where the Rebels seem to be coordinating their alliance with Dyro Felldor."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_24_intro2 "We've also confirmed Felldor is on-site. Destroy him and put a stop to this matter permanently."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_24_outro1 "That's it? After all that boom and bluster, you'd think he'd have put up more of a fight. What a chump."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_24_outro2 "Good work, Operative. With Felldor's defeat and the destruction of the Rebel presence on Er'Kit, the planet should fall into line."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_24_outro3 'And should it forget who its true masters are, the Empire will be waiting to remind them. Return to base. Subsector command out.'
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_24_tip1 "Ahh, so you're here! I've worked too hard to secure this alliance to accept defeat now. Time to face my troops!"
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_25_intro1 'Hello, is this thing on? Oh, hey there, Operative. Just thought you should know, all those Rebel troops I drew away for you...'
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_25_intro2 "Well, they're not so happy about you destroying their base, so they're coming to blow up yours. Just thought you might want a heads up."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_25_outro1 "I had a feeling that hotshot's plan and cavalier attitude would find a way to backfire on us. "
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_25_outro2 'Senator Kessen has proven to be an invaluable ally, Operative Saponza. His underworld connections were the key to our success.'
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_25_outro3 "I trust you won't retaliate... much? Operative, good work. Er'Kit is pacified and there are other matters to attend to. As you were."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_2_intro1 'This appears to be where that attack came from. Fan out and search the area.'
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_2_outro1 'Operative, orbital surveillance is detecting a much larger force approaching your base. Return immediately.'
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_3_intro1 "Incoming attack from more Er'Kit forces! Where are they all coming from?"
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_3_outro1 "Scanners detect more enemies inbound. Let's find out where they're comin' from and put a stop to it!"
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_3_outro2 'Operative, your forces must remain to defend your base. [F2D62F]tJohhar Kessen[-] is still on Tatooine. I will enlist his assistance.'
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_4_intro1 'Hey there, Operative. I got the request for help from Kosh and rounded up some local scum in the Mos Espa cantina.'
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_4_intro2 "I've got two kinds of mooks here to help: the fellas in the hats can take quite a beating, and the Renegades on bikes overcharged their laser cannons."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_4_intro3 "As for me, I'll shoot any enemy troops from a safe distance. Let's get to work."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_4_outro1 "Alright, Operative. The pressure on your base should ease up. There's one more landing zone."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_4_outro2 "Whoever these clowns are, they have a pretty well defended base. I'll meet you there, and we can shoot the place up together."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_5_intro1 "The size of that transport craft suggests this is the main landing site of this Er'Kit militia force. Approach with caution, Operative."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_5_intro2 'Looks like they have a Droideka Sentinel defending the base. I can make short work of it if you can distract it for me.'
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_5_outro1 "You may have dealt with the Er'Kit forces on Tatooine, but now we must determine where they came from and why they have Rebel weapons."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_5_outro2 "Return to the site of the Blood Dawn HQ on Er'Kit and see if there are any clues to be found in the rubble."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_6_intro1 "Somebody is already here, scouring these ruins. Let's introduce ourselves."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_6_outro1 "More Er'Kit troops with Rebel weapons. I don't like it. No other leads though."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_6_outro2 "It's time to come at this sideways, Partner."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_7_intro1 "Operative, all we know so far is that we are being attacked by Er'Kit outfitted with Rebel weapons. We need to know more."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_7_intro2 'Attack this base and steal whatever intelligence you can.'
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_7_outro1 'Partner, I think we caught a break. According to this data there is a Rebel spy who has the information we need, being held by Tusken Raiders.'
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_7_outro2 'If we get there fast enough we might be able to capture him from the Tusken.'
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_8_intro1 "And there you have it. One Rebel spy waiting for rescue. I bet he'll be surprised to see us. Let's get him."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_8_outro1 'Good work securing the Rebel spy, Operative. We will find out what he knows and use it to plan our next course of action.'
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_9_intro1 "According to what we learned from the captured Rebel spy, this base is secretly holding files pertaining to the operations on Er'Kit."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_9_intro2 "Sounds good. Let's hit it hard, Partner. See what we can find once we've knocked out the defenses."
    dia_evt_6_sa_e_9_outro1 "The Rebel files we've recovered are encrypted. It will take some time to decipher them."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_0_intro1 'Hey partner, I\'m hearing some odd things in the cantina. We\'d best be prepared to make some new "friends".'
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_10_fail1 'If an enemy attack seems too powerful, ensure the base is well defended with strategically placed turrets, shield generators, walls, and traps.'
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_10_outro1 'Agent, while we work to decrypt the files, maybe you should see about destroying the base these attacks are being launched from.'
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_13_outro1 "Good news, Agent. We have finally broken the encryption on the Imperial data. I'm sending you some coordinates on Er'Kit. Please head there."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_14_intro1 "Partner, according to Jennica this base belongs to the Er'Kit militia that attacked us. They're being trained by the Empire. Let's get to it."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_14_outro1 "Ahh, Agent. Good to see you again. You remember me, I trust? I see you've become acquainted with the local troublemakers."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_14_outro2 "I'm afraid with the defeat of the Blood Dawn there was something of a... power vacuum here on Er'Kit. This group decided to side with the Empire."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_14_outro3 "A most unfortunate turn of events. It seems whomever they are working for is trying to seize power over Er'Kit."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_15_intro1 "The decrypted coordinates have also led us to this base. If we're lucky, taking it out will stop the attacks on us."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_15_outro1 "I'm afraid I really must insist you stop your activities on Er'Kit. We are grateful for your help with the Blood Dawn, but this is an internal matter."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_15_outro2 'Internal matter my ass! They attacked us, Dyro. Myaybe you should handle your "internal matters" before they show up on our front door?'
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_16_intro1 "I suppose it's come to this then. I had hoped we could keep my true allegiances in the dark, but you've forced my hand by attacking my bases."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_16_intro2 "For what it's worth, I'm grateful for your elimination of the Blood Dawn. They were all that stood in my way. Now it's just you."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_16_outro1 "Dyro... is working for the Empire? That's not good."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_16_outro2 "My thoughts exactly, Agent Saponza. We cannot let Er'Kit fall into the hands of the Empire. We need more intel on what's going on here."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_16_outro3 'I am going to contact Senator Kessen again. With his underworld connections, surely he can find the leads we seem to be missing.'
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_17_int1 'Ha ha! Wow, look at it burn. What is that made out of? Explosives?'
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_17_int2 "No! That one had sentimental value! You'll regret that, Johhar Kessen!"
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_17_intro1 'Agent, this place is run by a bird named Liana. She escaped an Imperial prison transport and has been making a living selling "like new" weapons.'
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_17_intro2 "And I hear she recently sold some of those weapons to our friend Dyro on Er'Kit. Why don't we drop in for a visit?"
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_17_intro3 "I've got two new kinds of hirelings with me: the Chiss ladies will shoot whatever is closest, and the Jawas will dismantle any shield generators."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_17_mid1 'Damn you, Kessen! That one was in mint condition! Do you even know how hard it is to steal those from the Empire?'
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_17_mid2 "Well, tell me what I want to know darlin' and I'll stop blowing up your stuff."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_17_outro1 "Okay darlin'... Look, you're running out of things for me to destroy. Tell me about the your shipment to Er'kit already."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_17_outro2 "Fine. Just take the info and leave. But know this: I'll get you back for this, Kessen. Some day, somehow. You'll pay."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_17_outro3 "Why Liana Kor, do I detect a hint of anger in your hologram? It's actually a good look for you..."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_17_tip1 'Oh, wow. That looked expensive. Sorry about that one, Kor.'
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_17_tip2 "You'll pay for that, Kessen!"
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_18_intro1 "According to the manifests, all of Liana's weapons were sent to this location. Looks like some kind of shipment facility."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_18_outro1 "I've gone over the shipping logs. The Empire was definitely using Liana's operation to funnel weapons and supplies to Dyro's little militia."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_18_outro2 "I've got coordinates for several more facilities here on Er'Kit. Let's take them offline for good."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_19_intro1 'This would appear to be where the Empire is storing all of its weapon shipments for distribution.'
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_19_outro1 "Agent, once again I see you can't leave well enough alone. For the first time in a generation, Er'Kit has stability."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_19_outro2 'And what do you do? Come in, guns blazing, disrupting my new alliance with the Empire!'
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_1_intro1 "Man the defenses! We're under attack!"
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_1_outro2 "Er'Kit... commandos? Since when do the Er'Kit have a military force?"
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_1_outro3 "Even more troublesome, Agent: The Er'Kit were using [F2D62F]Imperial[-] infantry tactics. This could be the start of a major threat."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_20_intro1 'This was to be the place the Empire would instruct my recruits, in the first non-human stormtrooper training program.'
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_20_intro2 "And you're ruining it."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_20_outro1 "Can that really be the same guy who helped us against the Blood Dawn? I can't believe it was just a plot for him to seize power."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_20_outro2 "I too find it disturbing, Agent Saponza. We cannot allow Er'Kit to fall under the sway of a despot, allied with the Empire."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_21_intro1 'Yes! The time has come to put that Imperial training to use. Attack!'
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_21_intro2 "Agent, I do hope you're not getting attached to this base. Because my troops are about to destroy it."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_21_outro1 "Dyro's getting desperate, Agent. But we're in the home stretch, now. Return to Er'Kit and finish this."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_22_intro1 "And here you are again. You're getting predictable, Agent."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_22_intro2 "Ahh, you must be the Agent who has so vexed our... allies here on Er'Kit. Your advance stops here, Rebel scum."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_22_outro1 "That's Captain Kosh! He's in charge of the subsector Tatooine is located in. He must be coordinating this for the Empire."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_22_outro2 "We kicked his butt across Tatooine, so now he's on Er'Kit. I don't like it."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_22_outro3 'Agent, I have a plan to lure out the defenders of the final Imperial base. Contact Senator Kessen. He will explain. Good luck.'
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_23_intro1 "This Imperial base is a whopper. I'm going to help you draw it's defenders away with a ruse."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_23_intro2 "I've also managed to round up a few thieves who will do a number on resources, and some old refurbished tanks. Let's get to it."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_23_outro1 "Okay, that does it. Let's get out of here. The entire remainder of the planetary garrison will be here any minute."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_23_outro2 "Have fun storming the castle, Agent. I'll see you around."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_23_tip1 "Okay, I'm tapped into their comms array. I'm going to spoof a distress call. Watch this..."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_23_tip2 "Command, this is outpost, er... 23! We're under attack by a bunch of inexpensive cannon fodder and a devilishly handsome rogue!"
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_23_tip3 'Copy, outpost 23. Reinforcements are inbound to your location.'
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_24_intro1 "Agent, this is the final Imperial base on Er'kit, where Kosh seems to have been coordinating his alliance with Dyro."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_24_intro2 "We've also confirmed Dyro is on-site. Let's take out the maniac who started all this, and prevent Er'Kit from falling into the Empire's clutches."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_24_outro1 "That's it? After all that boom and bluster, you'd think he'd have put up more of a fight. What a chump."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_24_outro2 "Good work, Agent. With Dyro's defeat and the destruction of the Imperial presence on Er'Kit, the planet should be safe."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_24_outro3 "With luck, the Er'Kit people may see fit to aid the Rebellion in our struggle now that they know the Empire for what it is."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_24_tip1 "Ahh, so you're here! I've worked too hard to secure this alliance to accept defeat now. Time to face my troops!"
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_25_intro1 'Hello, is this thing on? Oh, hey there, Agent. Just thought you should know, all those Imperial troops I drew away for you...'
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_25_intro2 "Well, they're not so happy about you destroying their base, so they're coming to blow up yours. Just thought you might want a heads up."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_25_outro1 "I had a feeling that hotshot's plan and cavalier attitude would find a way to backfire on us. "
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_25_outro2 'His attitude aside, Senator Kessen has proven to be an invaluable resource for the Rebel Alliance, Agent Saponza.'
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_25_outro3 'Good work, Agent. We hurt the Empire today. And any day we can do that is a good one. May the Force be with you.'
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_2_intro1 'This appears to be where that attack came from. Fan out, search, and watch for [F2D62F]traps[-].'
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_2_outro1 'Agent, you need to return immediately! A much larger force is bearing down on our base!'
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_3_intro1 "We've got a big mass of Er'Kit troops inbound! Man the defenses!"
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_3_outro1 "Scanners detect more enemies inbound. Let's find out where they're comin' from and put a stop to it!"
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_3_outro2 'Agent, I have an idea. [F2D62F]Johhar Kessen[-] is on Tatooine. With his connections, we can get access to some mercenary troops.'
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_4_intro1 'Hey there, Agent. I got the request for help from that Jennica gal, and rounded up some local scum in the Mos Espa cantina.'
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_4_intro2 "I've got two kinds of mooks here to help: the fellas in the hats can take quite a beating, and the Renegades on bikes overcharged their laser cannons."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_4_intro3 "As for me, I'll shoot any enemy troops from a safe distance. Let's get to work."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_4_outro1 "Alright, Agent. The pressure on your base should ease up, now. There's only one more landing zone."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_4_outro2 "Whoever these clowns are, they have a pretty well defended base. I'll meet you there, and we can shoot the place up together."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_5_intro1 "The size of that transport craft suggests this is the main landing site of this Er'Kit militia force that is attacking us. Good luck, Agent."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_5_intro2 'Looks like they have a Droideka Sentinel defending the base. I can make short work of it if you can distract it for me.'
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_5_outro1 "It looks like we've dealt with the Er'Kit forces on Tatooine, but we need to learn more about who they are and why they attacked us."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_5_outro2 "We don't have any leads right now, but maybe we can give the site of the former Blood Dawn HQ a once over and see if we missed anything."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_6_intro1 "Somebody is already here, scouring these ruins. Let's introduce ourselves."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_6_outro1 "More Er'Kit troops. I don't like it. No other leads though."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_6_outro2 "It's time to come at this sideways, Partner."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_7_intro1 "Agent, all we know so far is that we are being attacked by Er'Kit using Imperial infantry tactics. We need to know more."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_7_intro2 'Attack this base and steal whatever intelligence you can. Hopefully it will generate some leads.'
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_7_outro1 'Partner, I think we caught a break. According to this data there is an Imperial spy who has the clearance we need, being held by Tusken Raiders.'
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_7_outro2 'If we get there fast enough we might be able to capture him from the Tuskens.'
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_8_intro1 "And there you have it. One Imperial spy waiting for rescue. I bet he'll be surprised to see us. Let's get him."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_8_outro1 'Good work securing the Imperial spy, Agent. We will find out what he knows and use it to plan our next course of action.'
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_9_intro1 "According to what we learned from the captured Imperial spy, this base is secretly holding files pertaining to the operations on Er'Kit."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_9_intro2 "Sounds good. Let's hit it hard, Partner. See what we can find once we've knocked out the defenses."
    dia_evt_6_sa_r_9_outro1 'The files we recovered are encrypted, but with time we should be able to crack them. Good work, Agent.'
    dia_evt_7_rw_e_0_intro1 'Operative, it seems that Tusken Raiders have been attacking Jawa sandcrawlers carrying Contraband shipments for Jabba the Hutt.'
    dia_evt_7_rw_e_0_intro2 "Jabba's head of security, [F2D62F]Kada Jahr[-], has asked us to intervene. Ordinarily, the Empire would not stoop to the level of such criminals."
    dia_evt_7_rw_e_0_intro3 'However, the potential for future profit is too high to ignore. Rebel aggression forces us to use every tool at our disposal, after all.'
    dia_evt_7_rw_e_0_intro4 "Hello, Operative. I understand your superior's hesitation at being involved. I assure you that this arrangement will be profitable for both of us."
    dia_evt_7_rw_e_10_outro1 "We've got hostiles incoming back at the base! Let's get a move on, partner."
    dia_evt_7_rw_e_11_intro1 'Incoming hostiles! Who could be behind this?'
    dia_evt_7_rw_e_11_outro1 "My intel has led to an Aqualish crime lord named [F2D62F]Nhego Roolan[-]. It seems he's bribed the Tuskens to steal Contraband here on Tatooine."
    dia_evt_7_rw_e_11_outro2 "You dealt with the Tusken Raiders, but as we now know, they're not the real problem. I'll look into Roolan some more."
    dia_evt_7_rw_e_12_intro1 "It seems the Contraband was transferred from the Tusken enclaves to Nhego Roolan's outposts before we learned of the sandcrawler attacks."
    dia_evt_7_rw_e_12_intro2 'His forces are too heavily armed for any immediate assault. Take out this weapons depot first, to dull their teeth.'
    dia_evt_7_rw_e_12_intro3 'Use these [F2D62F]TIE Advanced[-] to soften up the shields, and [F2D62F]VT-49 Decimators[-] to target infantry before deploying all your forces.'

    dia_evt_7_rw_e_21_outro3 "He's in here! Stop him! He's getting away!"
    dia_evt_7_rw_e_22_intro1 'The intelligence on Nhego Roolan is clearly faulty. He is dangerous, Operative. No one can explain how he infiltrated our base during the battle.'
    dia_evt_7_rw_e_22_intro2 'Subsector Command has made it clear: your orders are to destroy his remaining outposts. Capture him if you can, but kill him if you must.'

    dia_evt_7_rw_e_23_outro1 "Operative, make sure you've built a [F2D62F]Contraband Safehouse[-]. You'll need a place to put any Contraband you import or capture in the future."

    dia_evt_7_rw_e_25_outro2 'Subsector Command does not condone illegal activity, of course, but we must do everything in our power to eradicate the Rebels.'

    dia_evt_8_rs_e_0_intro2 "As you may know, the Empire suffered a... strategic setback in that system, when the Death Star was destroyed in Yavin's orbit."
    dia_evt_8_rs_e_0_intro3 'The Rebels behind this attack made a hasty evacuation from their secret base on the moon, and sources say they may have left some vital intel behind.'

    dia_evt_8_rs_e_12_intro1 'Lotsa Rebels on this moon, partner. They really mean to keep our noses out of their secrets. '
    dia_evt_8_rs_e_15_intro1 "If we do find this intel, I wonder if we'll find out how they destroyed something as incredible as the Death Star?"
    dia_evt_8_rs_e_15_intro2 "Information like that will be very valuable to the Empire, partner. Maybe they'll even use it to build a new one?"
    dia_evt_8_rs_e_1_intro1 "Looks like the Rebels got here before us, partner, which means General Veer's intel was spot on."
    dia_evt_8_rs_e_1_intro2 'If there really are Rebel secrets here on Yavin 4, we should get our hands on them before they get a chance to destroy these data centers.'
    dia_evt_8_rs_e_20_outro1 'Excellent work thus far, Operative. Your skills are to be commended. Continue your work on Yavin 4. Veers out.'
    dia_evt_8_rs_e_23_outro1 'Operative, the interdiction-class destroyer Hunter has been dispatched to Yavin and tasked with orbital surveillance.'
    dia_evt_8_rs_e_23_outro2 'It should arrive in system shortly and assist in locating the command and control facility for Rebel operations on the moon.'
    dia_evt_8_rs_e_23_outro3 'Additionally it will prevent escape from the system if necessary. Find the Rebel leader and put a stop to their operations.'
    dia_evt_8_rs_e_24_outro1 "Partner, I'm getting a signal from the Hunter. They found the Rebel command that has secured the data centers and are sending coordinates now."
    dia_evt_8_rs_e_24_outro2 "They say they'll stay until we handle the ground ops and make sure Rebels don't leave the surface."
    dia_evt_8_rs_e_25_intro1 "Our friends in orbit have confirmed this is where the Rebels are coordinating the destruction of the intel from. Let's take it down."
    dia_evt_8_rs_e_25_outro1 'Operative, your efforts have been crucial. The Rebels put up a serious fight, but our mission was still of some success.'
    dia_evt_8_rs_e_25_outro2 'While they were able to secure and destroy most of their data centers, your attacks provided the distraction we needed to recover the rest.'
    dia_evt_8_rs_e_25_outro3 'Let us hope this information proves to be valuable. Continue to sweep this moon for Rebel bases. Veers out.'
    dia_evt_8_rs_e_2_intro1 "This couldn't be the base the general was speaking of... but I'm willing to bet these Rebels are protecting something. Let's show 'em how we do."

    dia_evt_8_rs_r_0_intro3 'Rebel forces were forced to flee Yavin 4 immediately after the battle, but in their haste, some of our data centers were not completely destroyed.'
    dia_evt_8_rs_r_0_intro4 'We suspect the Imperials are on their way to the moon as we speak, in an attempt to recover our secrets. We must return to Yavin 4 and destroy the data.'
    dia_evt_8_rs_r_10_outro1 "We're going to need to keep the Empire away for as long as possible while Rebel Agents secure the data. "
    dia_evt_8_rs_r_10_outro2 "The Empire is looking to expose a hole in our defenses and get to the data centers before us. We won't let them do that, will we, Agent?"
    dia_evt_8_rs_r_12_intro1 "Lotsa bucket heads on this moon, Partner. They really want to get to those data centers. Good thing we're here to stop 'em, eh?"
    dia_evt_8_rs_r_15_intro1 "Whatever these secrets we're protecting are, partner, the Imperials want them badly."
    dia_evt_8_rs_r_15_intro2 "What if they contain coordinates to secret Rebel bases? If so, we can't let the Imperials get their hands on them!"
    dia_evt_8_rs_r_1_intro1 'Looks like the Imperials already beat us here, partner. Once we locate the data centers, we should set up a perimeter...'

    dia_evt_8_rs_r_20_outro1 'Keep at it, Agent. The Rebel Alliance is counting on your success in this operation.'

    dia_evt_8_rs_r_23_outro2 'It should arrive in system shortly and assist in locating the command and control facility for Imperial operations on Yavin 4.'
    dia_evt_8_rs_r_23_outro3 "Once it's identified, hit that location, and hit it hard."
    dia_evt_8_rs_r_24_outro1 "We're getting a signal from the ship in orbit. They've located the command garrison and are sending coordinates now."
    dia_evt_8_rs_r_24_outro2 "They say they'll stay until we handle the ground ops and warn us if Imperial reinforcements arrive."
    dia_evt_8_rs_r_25_intro1 "Our friends in orbit say this is where the Imperials are coordinating their ops on Yavin 4 from. Let's take it down."
    dia_evt_8_rs_r_25_outro1 'Agent, good work on Yavin 4. Your attacks on the Imperials provided us with the time we needed.'
    dia_evt_8_rs_r_25_outro2 'Unfortunately, I just received a report that the Imperials may have gotten away with some of the data.'
    dia_evt_8_rs_r_25_outro3 'I doubt it will prove useful to them, but I urge you to sweep the moon and destroy any remaining garrisons.'
    dia_evt_8_rs_r_2_intro1 "Wow, partner, the Imperials really didn't waste any time setting up here on Yavin 4. Let's show 'em what we think of their plans."
    dia_evt_8_rs_r_2_outro1 'The Imperials have confirmed our suspicions, Agent.'
    dia_evt_8_rs_r_2_outro2 'They are massing forces here and setting up operations all over the moon. We have much work to do.'
    dia_evt_9_epffa_e_0_intro1 "Operative, it has come to my attention that your troops have become quite complacent and lazy. Too many mistakes have been made in combat, and it's time to whip them into shape."
    dia_evt_9_epffa_e_0_intro2 "I've prepared a series of 'training missions' for you. Take your troops and drill them until they collapse! I'll be closely monitoring your results."
    dia_evt_9_epffa_r_0_intro1 "Agent, our recruiting efforts have gone splendidly. So much so that we've now got a surplus of troops with too little combat experience. I'm counting on you to whip them into shape!"
    dia_evt_9_epffa_r_0_intro2 "Our scouts have provided me with an array of Imperial garrisons to raid. Nothing like real world training, right Commander? We'll mold these rookies into soldiers yet..."

    dia_forBiome_00 "Hey partner. After so long on Tatooine, there's more green on Dandoran, Yavin 4, and Takodana than I thought there could be in the whole galaxy. It's getting harder for our troops to manage all of it."
    dia_forBiome_01_e "That's why I think we should roll out some [c][F2D62F]forest equipment[-][/c]. There's new stuff coming on the market, and it packs enough of a punch to make the Rebels think twice!"

    dia_forBiome_03_r "How does that sound, partner? I think it's our best chance to stock up on forest equipment and remind the Empire just who they're dealing with!"
    dia_forBiome_Jetpack_01_e "I've been thinking, partner. Operating in forests and jungles puts us in danger of surprise attacks from the Rebels. I know of some equipment that will make the terrain more manageable."
    dia_forBiome_Jetpack_01_r "I've been thinking, partner. Forests and jungles are great for surprise attacks on the Empire, but we still have to worry about rough terrain. There's some equipment that will help with that."
    dia_forBiome_Jetpack_02_e 'These jetpacks have better output from both the blasters and the engines. Forest Jump Troopers can move faster and deal more damage. We can take any advantage away from those Rebels!'
    dia_forBiome_Jetpack_02_r "These jetpacks have extra output from both the blasters and the engines. Forest Jetpack Troopers shoot harder and move faster, even in rough country. It's perfect for pushing the Empire out!"
    dia_forBiome_Jetpack_03_e "Gather the Data Fragments for this equipment from any high-end supply crate. We can get crates in exchange for crystals, but we'd better move on it. Once word gets out, these'll disappear!"

    dia_joinsquad_r_intro1 'We stand a greater chance against the Empire united, Commander.'

    evt_itm_52_r_outro1 'Amazing work, Agent. The Imperial forces across most of Dandoran have fallen, and we are sifting through the intelligence windfall right now.'
    evt_itm_52_r_outro2 'We are investigating disturbing rumors of Imperial biological research on the southern continent. It may be that the battle for Dandoran is not yet over, Agent.'
    evt_itm_9_e_fail1 'Operative, you can expect the enemy to show you no mercy. Ensure your defenses are fully prepared for any attack, and defend your HQ at all costs.'
    evt_itm_9_e_intro1 'Operative, reports indicate an enemy force inbound. This is likely related to your ongoing efforts in the Dandoran Campaign.'
    evt_itm_9_r_fail1 "Agent, the Empire shows its foes no mercy. Make sure your base has upgraded turrets and other defenses, so you're able to fend off attacks."
    evt_itm_9_r_intro1 'Agent, an enemy force is inbound. They are likely trying to stop you from continuing your activities on Dandoran.'
    evt_ts_10_e_intro1 "Welcome back, partner. While you were unloading, we've been talkin' with a squad of troopers that managed to escape Dandoran."
    evt_ts_10_e_intro2 "The connection's a little weak. Let me try boosting the signal."
    evt_ts_10_e_intro3 'Mu... mur... MURGHHHHHHH!'
    evt_ts_10_e_outro1 "I think that's the last of them, partner."
    evt_ts_10_e_outro2 'No, Operative Saponza. Subsector command has received numerous distress calls across Tatooine. Your orders are to contain this threat by any means necessary.'
    evt_ts_10_r_intro1 'Sorry to cut the welcome short, Agent. Our scouts are investigating a transport that crashed nearby. Transmission incoming.'
    evt_ts_10_r_intro2 'Grrrraaaahh! Mmmmmrrrr... Rrrrrrggggghhhh!'
    evt_ts_10_r_intro3 "That ship must have come from Dandoran. We've got incoming Undead Troopers! Get ready to defend yourself, Agent. I suggest using your [F2D62F]HWK-290[-] starship strikes."
    evt_ts_10_r_outro1 "I think that's the last of them, partner."
    evt_ts_10_r_outro2 "I'm afraid not, Agent Saponza. We are picking up numerous distress calls across Tatooine. As soon as you can, gather a force and move out."
    evt_ts_11_e_intro1 'Operative, we have managed to capture some of these Undead Troopers. I am authorizing you to deploy them in your containment efforts.'
    evt_ts_11_e_intro2 'You want to use those things? Alongside our own troops? This is crazy!'
    evt_ts_11_e_intro3 'Did I not say "by any means necessary," Operative? You have your orders.'
    evt_ts_11_e_outro1 "This stinks worse than bantha poodoo, partner. I guess it's better having those Undead Troopers on the front lines than ourselves, though."
    evt_ts_11_r_intro1 'Agent, our scientists have managed to capture and subdue a large group of Undead Troopers. I have cleared you to deploy them in your efforts.'
    evt_ts_11_r_intro2 'Are you crazy, Jennica? You want us to use those things? Alongside our own troops?'
    evt_ts_11_r_intro3 'I don\'t relish the thought, Agent Saponza. But we must contain this threat by any means. "Fight fire with fire," so to speak.'
    evt_ts_11_r_outro1 'This stinks worse than bantha poodoo, partner. Better them than us, I guess.'
    evt_ts_17_e_outro1 "We've taken on a lot of infected bases, partner. I don't think Kosh understands what he's dealing with here. When we get back, I want some answers."
    evt_ts_17_r_outro1 "We've taken on a lot of infected bases, partner. I'm afraid this whole thing is getting out of hand. I hope Jennica has some answers for us."
    evt_ts_18_e_intro1 "I've had enough, Kosh. You're not telling us the whole story about these Undead Troopers. What is going on here?"
    evt_ts_18_e_intro2 'It will have to wait, Operative. Sensors are picking up a large group of Undead Troopers converging on your location now. I would advise you to get to your battle stations.'
    evt_ts_18_e_outro1 'Still there, Operative? It seems these Undead Troopers are a greater threat than anticipated. I am forced to send you back to Dandoran.'
    evt_ts_18_e_outro2 "There are still many infected bases out there that need to be destroyed. I'll continue to communicate with our scientists."
    evt_ts_18_e_outro3 "That Kosh is a real sleemo. Let's go to Dandoran and see if we can figure this out for ourselves."
    evt_ts_18_r_intro1 'Jennica, we need to talk. These Undead Troopers are popping up all over the place. It has me worried.'
    evt_ts_18_r_intro2 "I can't argue with that, Agent Saponza. Our sensors  are picking up a large group of Undead Troopers converging on your base. Get ready!"
    evt_ts_18_r_outro1 "Is everyone alright? Good. My sources have narrowed the source of the Undead Troopers to Dandoran's southern continent."
    evt_ts_18_r_outro2 "Go to Dandoran, find the source of Undead Troopers, and destroy it. I'm sending you coordinates to investigate."
    evt_ts_19_e_intro1 'We have coordinates for several locations which may be the source of the Undead Troopers. We presume these forces are hostile, so use any force necessary.'
    evt_ts_19_r_intro1 "Don't take any chances investigating the base. You can use your [F2D62F]HWK-290[-] starship strikes, and captured Undead Troopers. It's your call, partner."
    evt_ts_1_e_intro1 'Greetings Operative. Our success on Dandoran has given us the upper hand. '
    evt_ts_1_e_intro2 'My intel reports a lone Rebel outpost that was apparently... overlooked. Go destroy it.'
    evt_ts_1_e_outro1 "We've taken a look at their comm logs, and it seems they were spying on a nearby garrison. We should investigate this."
    evt_ts_1_r_intro1 'The Imperials on Dandoran have scattered, Agent. While we proceed with resource allocation as planned, I have a task for you.'
    evt_ts_1_r_intro2 "We've intercepted enemy communications from a remote Imperial outpost that we may have overlooked. I'll need you to investigate."
    evt_ts_1_r_outro1 'Judging by the crew logs, we just missed a quick evacuation. There are encrypted copies of recent transmissions, though...'
    evt_ts_1_r_outro2 'Our engineers will bring the data back to our Dandoran base to investigate further. Be ready, Agent.'
    evt_ts_24_r_outro1 'Operative, we have located the source of the Undead Troopers. Return to base for briefing.'
    evt_ts_25_e_intro1 'Unfortunately, we could not contain the virus at the research facility. Our orders are to destroy it and all evidence completely.'
    evt_ts_25_e_intro2 "Come on, Kosh. It can't be that simple. When are you going to tell us what's going on?"
    evt_ts_25_e_intro3 'Do your job, Operative, and I will brief you personally when you return. Kosh out.'
    evt_ts_25_e_outro1 'Alright, Kosh, we did your dirty work. We earned the right to know what this is all about.'
    evt_ts_25_e_outro2 'Very well, you earned it. The Undead Troopers came from a virus, codenamed Blackwing. It was borne of science and alchemy, designed to produce immortality!'
    evt_ts_25_e_outro3 "You're telling me those Sith scientists, this Project Blackwing, created Undead Troopers? On purpose?"
    evt_ts_25_e_outro4 "Yes, it's true. And I have faith that we'll crack this code one day. For now though, we must contain the outbreak and keep the secret out of Rebel hands."
    evt_ts_25_r_intro1 'Thanks to your search, we have located a research facility that appears to be the source of the Undead Troopers.'
    evt_ts_25_r_intro2 'The facility will be heavily fortified, and of course overrun by Undead Troopers. Remember your [F2D62F]HWK-290[-] starship strikes. Good luck out there, Agent.'
    evt_ts_25_r_outro1 'My sources confirm that the facility you destroyed housed none other than Project Blackwing.'
    evt_ts_25_r_outro2 "You're telling me those scientists, this Project Blackwing, created the Undead Troopers? On purpose?"
    evt_ts_25_r_outro3 'Perhaps not on purpose, Agent Saponza. The scientists probably got more than they bargained for.'
    evt_ts_25_r_outro4 "The primary threat is gone thanks to you, Agent. Now all that's left is hunting down any Undead Troopers remaining on Dandoran. Contact me when your forces are ready."
    evt_ts_26_e_intro1 'The Undead Trooper outbreak is not fully contained, and they are growing stronger. Continue to search for bases, and destroy them.'
    evt_ts_26_r_intro1 'Project Blackwing is no more, but the Deathtrooper threat still remains on Dandoran. Scour the planet for infested bases and wipe them out.'
    evt_ts_2_e_intro1 "Operative, I'm attempting to contact our remote garrison directly. There doesn't seem to be a response..."
    evt_ts_2_e_intro2 'Mu... mur... MURGHHHHHHH!'
    evt_ts_2_e_intro3 'What the heck was that?! Did that come from the garrison?'
    evt_ts_2_e_outro1 'I\'ve never seen anything like that, partner, and I\'ve seen some pretty horrible stuff. It was like some kind of "Undead Trooper."'
    evt_ts_2_e_outro2 'Operative, you must evacuate immediately. I will reveal more details in regard to the situation, if you keep this hush-hush.'
    evt_ts_2_r_intro1 "What we've discovered in the deciphered logs is disturbing, Agent, but explains quite a bit. It appears that the Imperials are faced with a... "
    evt_ts_2_r_intro2 "...well, I'll just let you see for yourself. Take a look at this recorded transmission."
    evt_ts_2_r_intro3 'Mu... mur... MURGHHHHHHH!'
    evt_ts_2_r_intro4 "I'm not exactly sure what we're dealing with here, Agent, but while I look into it, I'm sending you to find those garrisons. Be careful."
    evt_ts_2_r_outro1 'Were those reanimated dead troopers? What have the Imperials involved themselves in this time?'
    evt_ts_2_r_outro2 'This might be far more dangerous than we thought, Agent. I suggest we evacuate to Tatooine immediately.'
    evt_ts_3_e_intro1 "What's this?! Scouts are reporting Undead Troopers on Tatooine? They must have stowed away."
    evt_ts_3_e_intro2 "We shouldn't take our chances with blasters, partner. "
    evt_ts_3_e_intro3 "I've got an idea. I've been tinkering with some starships... These modded [F2D62F]VT-49's[-] are loaded with firebombs that will do a number on infantry. Try em out."
    evt_ts_3_e_outro1 'Kosh, I think you owe us an explanation. Where did these Undead Troopers come from?'
    evt_ts_3_e_outro2 'Do I, Operative Saponza? Information about our research facility on Dandoran is given out on a need-to-know basis, and you do not need to know.'
    evt_ts_3_e_outro3 'Until you do, your job is to contain this outbreak.'
    evt_ts_3_r_intro1 "We've got stowaways, partner! Some Undead Troopers must have made it onto the transport from Dandoran, and they're almost inside the base."
    evt_ts_3_r_intro2 'What are you going to do, Agent? You must not allow them inside the base.'
    evt_ts_3_r_intro3 'I have an idea, Jennica. I had our techs outfit some [F2D62F]HWK-290[-] starships with incendiary bombs. That should guarantee that these Undead Troopers stay dead.'
    evt_ts_3_r_outro1 "Satisfied with the [F2D62F]HWK-290[-], Jennica? Now how about telling us what's going on here?"
    evt_ts_3_r_outro2 "There's very little intel as of yet, but we believe that a group of Imperial scientists have been doing covert bio-weapons research on Dandoran."
    evt_ts_3_r_outro3 'These Undead Troopers are a threat to our resources on Dandoran. Search the planet and destroy them. Jennica, out.'
    evt_ts_3_r_outro4 "You heard her, partner. Let's put our new [F2D62F]HWK-290[-] starship strikes to good use on Dandoran."
    evt_ts_4_e_intro1 "Operative, we'll be needing your services on Dandoran once again. It appears there's been an outbreak, and it needs to be contained."
    evt_ts_4_e_outro1 "Looks like this thing has spread beyond the Empire's garrison. Let's keep looking for bases. Don't forget to use [F2D62F]VT-49[-] starship strikes on crowds of troops."
    evt_ts_4_r_intro1 "Troopers rising from the grave, and shooting back no less. It gives me the creeps, partner. Let's find those Undead Troopers and get it over with."
    evt_ts_4_r_outro1 "Looks like this thing has spread beyond the Empire's garrison. Let's keep looking for bases. Remember, [F2D62F]HWK-290[-] starship strikes work best against crowds of troops."
    evt_ts_7_r_intro1 'Keep up your search and destroy mission, Agent. The Rebel Alliance is counting on you.'
    evt_ts_9_e_outro1 'Acceptable work, Operative. That should be the last of them. Return to base for debriefing.'
    evt_ts_9_r_outro1 'Good work, Agent. Our scouts on Dandoran report that all is well. Return to base for debriefing.'

It is invisible to the enemy until an enemy unit enters the beacon's activation radius.

The Strix will remain empty until a new creature is captured!

    mis_aoc_1_r_intro3 "While I work to secure an alliance, begin the process of upgrading your outpost's alloy production facilities. You'll need them for what's to come."
    mis_aoc_1_r_outro1 'An alliance with Jawas? Jennica might be a little bit nuts to try that, but it just might work.'
    mis_aoc_2_r_fail1 'Agent, troops deployed once defenders have emerged will typically attack defenders before buildings.'

    mis_bs_14_e_fail1 'Partner, we can use those fancy AT-MP vehicles to destroy shields before sending in the troops.'
    mis_bs_14_e_intro1 'Operative, this Rebel base appears to be guarding the nearby structures. Additionally, there is a large sandstorm on the horizon. Work quickly.'
    mis_bs_14_e_outro1 "Sir, we've barely begun a search of the premises, and the sandstorm is almost on top of us. We have to evacuate."
    mis_bs_14_e_outro2 'Understood.  Gather whatever you can and send it to me immediately. Kosh out.'
    mis_bs_14_e_outro3 'Awfully odd that a sandstorm would come out of nowhere like that. The troops barely had time to search the place. Who knows what they could have missed?'
    mis_bs_14_r_fail1 "Partner, we have vehicles that can take out shields. Might want to use 'em."

    mis_bs_3_e_intro2 'Initiate a thorough search, Operative.'
    mis_bs_3_e_outro1 "Captain, the mercenaries here seem to have been gathering scrap. There's no way to tell where the passengers may have ended up."
    mis_bs_3_e_outro2 'A dead-end then... Operative, return to your base. We will have to expand the parameters of the search.'
    mis_bs_4_e_intro1 'In order to undertake this search, you will require enhanced support. Therefore, you will first need upgrade your HQ to level four.'
    mis_bs_4_e_outro1 'Keep in mind that what I am about to tell you is highly classified, Operative. Not long ago, Lord Vader visited Tatooine, searching for some droids.'
    mis_bs_4_e_outro2 'Shortly after, a freighter called the [F2D62F]Millenium Falcon[-] escaped the blockade, and fled the planet.'
    mis_bs_4_e_outro3 'I have reason to believe a Jedi named Obi-Wan Kenobi was on-board that ship. Meaning, he had been here on Tatooine. I will uncover his former hiding place.'
    mis_bs_5_e_intro1 'Operative, I have requisitioned TIE Bombers for this mission. You will not be permitted to deploy anything else. Do not fail me.'
    mis_bs_5_e_outro1 'Conducting a search over the whole of Tatooine will require you to have Heroes to support ground operations. Return to your base for further instructions.'
    mis_bs_6_e_intro1 'Operative, to mobilize Heroes and elite units in combat, you will need a [F2D62F]Hero Command[-]. Construct one now.'
    mis_bs_6_e_outro1 'Heroes and elites are powerful units, many times more effective than a single unit. Proper use of them can be the difference between victory or defeat.'
    mis_bs_7_e_intro1 'Operative, the Rebels are launching an attack. Fortunately for you, the bomber crews are able to respond. Show the Rebels the error of their ways.'
    mis_bs_7_e_outro1 "Operative, mobilized Heroes will be at your disposal [F2D62F]only when you attack a rival Rebel player's base[-], or when you are participating in a Campaign."
    mis_bs_7_e_outro2 'When you are engaged in other activities, Heroes will be assigned to you if necessary. Now, back to the task at hand.'
    mis_bs_8_e_intro1 'Ever since the... setback on Yavin 4, the Rebels have been emboldened. They often operate in the open, espousing their traitorous ideals.'
    mis_bs_8_e_intro2 "So, you will combine the search for Kenobi's hideout with strikes against the Rebels. The two are bound to be linked."
    mis_bs_8_e_outro1 'You know, I never did trust those Jedi when I was younger, partner. Always sitting in their temple and judging us regular people.'
    mis_bs_8_e_outro2 "It'll be interesting to see where this Jedi was living all those years. It's a pretty big fall from grace to go from Coruscant to Tatooine."
    mis_bs_9_e_intro1 'Hey partner, you see those shields? I bet we can use that Veteran AT-ST to make short work of them.'
    mis_bs_9_e_outro1 'Sir, no useful intelligence in this Rebel outpost.'
    mis_bs_9_e_outro2 "Okay, let's move on then."
    mis_cw_10_e_intro1 'Operative, your progress so far is good. Continue to strike at the Rebels. Intelligence indicates many enemy installations remain.'

    mis_cw_1_e_fail1 'Operative, the battles on Dandoran are going to be difficult. Ensure you take a full army and plan your attacks carefully. Tactics are the key to victory.'
    mis_cw_1_e_intro1 'Operative, a unique opportunity has come about, and I intend to seize it. In a neighboring system lies the planet [F2D62F]Dandoran[-].'
    mis_cw_1_e_intro2 "Haven't heard of it? I'm not surprised. Until very recently, the planet was an unimportant backwater, much like Tatooine continues to be."
    mis_cw_1_e_intro3 'Rebel presence is suspected on the planet. Sector command has tasked me with sending someone to investigate. And I have decided to send you. '
    mis_cw_1_e_intro4 'Since the Doran system neighbors the Tatoo system, you are the closest garrison able to undertake this mission.'
    mis_cw_1_e_intro5 'Coordinates of targets on Dandoran will be transmitted to you. Do not fail me, Operative. Kosh out.'
    mis_cw_1_r_fail1 'Agent, the battles on Dandoran are going to be difficult. Ensure you take a full army and plan your attacks carefully. Tactics are the key to victory.'
    mis_cw_1_r_intro1 'Agent, have you ever heard of the planet [F2D62F]Dandoran[-]? It lies in the neighboring Doran system.'
    mis_cw_1_r_intro2 "Until very recently, the planet wasn't on anyone's radar. But, for some reason, the Empire has dramatically increased their presence there."
    mis_cw_1_r_intro3 "Rebel command wants to know why. They've asked me to investigate, so I'd like you to start harassing the Imperials there and see what you can uncover."
    mis_cw_1_r_intro4 'Once you arrive in-system, I will transmit the coordinates of a number of Imperial garrisons. Work on destroying them while gathering intel.'
    mis_cw_1_r_intro5 'May the Force be with you, Agent.'
    mis_cw_20_e_outro1 'Excellent work pacifying the Rebel traitors, Operative. There are a few installations remaining; however, scans reveal them to be heavily fortified.'
    mis_cw_20_e_outro2 'Choose your forces and deployment carefully. Phase one of the Dandoran Campaign is almost complete. Do not fail me, Operative.'
    mis_cw_20_r_outro1 "Very impressive work, Agent. Only a few enemy bases remain, but they look heavily fortified. Looks like they're expecting an attack."
    mis_cw_20_r_outro2 "Choose your forces and deployment carefully. We're making good progress; the western continent is almost clear of Imperials.  Jennica out."
    mis_cw_2_e_intro1 "Operative, phase one of the [F2D62F]Dandoran Campaign[-] will focus on the elimination of several Rebel outposts on the planet's western continent."
    mis_cw_2_e_intro2 'Destroy the Rebel traitors wherever you find them. Doing so will earn you [F2D62F]Event Points[-] which you can use to purchase resources from the Quartermaster.'

    mis_cw_3_e_intro1 'I have decided to allocate to you some [F2D62F]Imperial Shock Troopers[-]. They are breacher infantry and excel at destroying walls from range.'
    mis_cw_3_e_intro2 'Remember: if you are successful in the Campaign, you will earn [F2D62F]Event Points[-] you can use to acquire more specialized troops, or the ability to train them yourself.'
    mis_cw_3_r_intro1 "Agent, I've called in some favors and gained you access to [F2D62F]Vanguard Soldiers[-]. They excel at demolishing walls from range and will be invaluable in defeating fortified bases."
    mis_cw_3_r_intro2 'And remember: as you progress in this Campaign you will earn [F2D62F]Event Points[-]. You can spend these to get additional Vanguards, resources, or other benefits.'
    mis_cw_5a_e_intro1 'Operative, intelligence section reports that a Rebel attack is incoming. This appears related to the Dandoran Campaign.'
    mis_cw_5a_e_intro2 "Attacks are likely to be a problem until you crush the Rebels on Dandoran. Don't slack on base defense, Operative."

    mis_rsf_11_r_outro2 "Sounds like infantry, partner. We'd better get ready."

    mis_rsf_12_r_outro1 "Truly amazing work, Agent. By defeating the full brunt of Kosh's forces, you've just forced him to be on the defensive."
    mis_rsf_12_r_outro2 "Even now that he knows where our base is, he won't be able to attack again for a while. And that gives us precious time."
    mis_rsf_12_r_outro3 'The battle for Tatooine has truly begun now. Thanks to you and Saponza, we might just pull it off and kick the Empire off the planet.'
    mis_rsf_1_r_intro1 'Rebel base sighted! All units attack!'
    mis_rsf_1_r_intro1a "Hey partner, we're intercepting an Imperial comm signal... coming from real close, too."
    mis_rsf_1_r_outro1 'That was a close call, Agent. Imperial patrols are increasing in frequency. They know we are on Tatooine.'
    mis_rsf_1_r_outro2 "I don't think we can wait any longer. We will have to strike at the Empire now. Prepare an assault force."
    mis_rsf_2_r_intro1 'What is this? Rebel scum! You will never defeat the Empire! Troopers, to your stations. Destroy these traitors!'
    mis_rsf_2_r_intro2 'Sergeant Oto Vans reporting, sir. Jennica asked me to help you from now on. Awaiting orders...'
    mis_rsf_2_r_outro1 "That was Captain Kosh. He's the officer in charge of the Empire's Tatooine garrison. Regroup at base."
    mis_rsf_3_r_intro1 "Agent, the Empire's defenses are increasing. To keep pace, we will need to deploy larger forces into combat."
    mis_rsf_3_r_intro2 'To ensure you can deploy the largest force possible, have two level four Unit Transports in your base.'
    mis_rsf_3_r_outro1 'I have uploaded the coordinates of all the remaining minor Imperial bases we know about on Tatooine.'
    mis_rsf_3_r_outro2 'You need to destroy them before we can make a run at the main regional base: Fort Sunfire.'
    mis_rsf_4_r_intro1 "This village was forced to shelter the Empire's forces. Let's fix that, Agent."
    mis_rsf_4_r_outro1 "Good work. The villagers will be grateful we've freed them. We've fired the first shot in the battle for Tatooine."
    mis_rsf_5_r_intro1 "The Empire sure is putting a lot of effort into finding us, partner. I wonder if they're just trying to save face, or there's something else going on here."
    mis_rsf_5_r_intro2 'Anyway, best if we level this outpost too.'
    mis_rsf_5_r_outro1 "What's so important about Tatooine anyway? You remember when Darth Vader paid us to hit a Tusken village? Why would Vader even care about this backwater sandball?"
    mis_rsf_5_r_outro2 'Something fishy about this if you ask me, partner. The Empire has more going on here than just a local garrison. Keep your eyes and ears open.'
    mis_rsf_6_r_intro1 "My sources tell me this is an Imperial Alloy processing facility. In order to destroy it quickly, I'm sending you a large contingent of Pathfinders."
    mis_rsf_6_r_intro2 'They are equipped with weapons attuned to deal heavy damage to resource buildings, and will make short work of this base.'
    mis_rsf_6_r_intro3 'But be careful, as they are lightly armored. Without a stronger unit to distract the defenders, the Pathfinders may not survive long.'
    mis_rsf_6_r_outro1 'Not bad, partner. I think we should consider using some of these Pathfinders when we attack those Imperial Operatives.'
    mis_rsf_7_r_intro1 "Here we go, partner. Let's upgrade our Barracks to level four, so we can accommodate those Pathfinders we just saw in action!"
    mis_rsf_7_r_outro1 "Looking good. Can't wait to try 'em out!"
    mis_rsf_8_r_intro1 'Agent, this would appear to be another Alloy processing facility. You are, of course, free to choose your deployment, but I suggest sending in Pathfinders if you have them.'
    mis_rsf_8_r_outro1 'Now that we have deprived the Empire of their alloy processing and shipments, we can attack more fortified targets. Be ready.'
    mis_rsf_9_r_intro1 'We are nearly ready to strike at the main Imperial garrison on this side of Tatooine: Fort Sunfire. But first, we must take out this listening station.'
    mis_rsf_9_r_outro1 'Good work Agent. Be prepared for a very difficult fight. Fort Sunfire is next and will not fall easily.'
    mis_sas_10_e_intro1 'Our Mole has uncovered a large Rebel presence on Dandoran. Not surprising, given the lax security we last saw there, no?'
    mis_sas_10_e_intro2 "This is the opportunity we've needed. Hit this base, and hit it hard. Veers out."
    mis_sas_10_e_outro1 "By making the Rebels think we're going after their Dandoran base, we can cause them to leave Kessen undefended."
    mis_sas_10_r_intro1 "There's a big Empire base on Dandoran. We're going to make them think we're going after it."
    mis_sas_10_r_intro2 "Step one, hit an Imperial Operative's base, and make it hurt."
    mis_sas_10_r_outro1 "Next, we take out the staging area on Dandoran where they're storing a division of AT-ATs."
    mis_sas_11_e_intro1 'This is a staging area for the Rebel attacks. Destroy it, and make it flashy so they think the whole fleet is coming in after them.'
    mis_sas_11_e_intro2 'Do not get too comfortable taking orders from General Veers, Operative. Remember, I am still your commanding officer.'
    mis_sas_11_e_outro1 "Good. Our mole reports a lot of Rebel activity on Dandoran. The plan worked. They think we're going after their main base."
    mis_sas_11_e_outro2 "Return to base. It's time to spring the trap."
    mis_sas_11_r_intro1 "This base provides a lot of support to a larger base nearby. They'll think we're going after the main Dandoran garrison."
    mis_sas_11_r_intro2 "But, while they're busy pulling in everything they've got for that, we're going after the real prize."
    mis_sas_11_r_outro1 "Okay, partner. Get ready. I found Kessen, and it's time to spring him."
    mis_sas_11_r_outro2 "Senator Kessen? Wait... I've heard of that guy. They say he killed a Rancor with a hunting knife on an expedition to Dathomir. Can't wait to meet him!"
    mis_sas_12_e_intro1 'Johhar Kessen is a former senator, partner. Connected all over the galaxy, and a legendary hunter to boot, if you believe the stories.'
    mis_sas_12_e_intro2 "I'd heard the Rebels were tryin' to woo him. Looks like that's about to go sideways."
    mis_sas_12_e_intro3 'This is it, Agent. Deploy your forces and destroy the Shield generator. Our bombers will do the rest.'
    mis_sas_12_e_outro1 'You could have just knocked, you know.'
    mis_sas_12_e_outro2 'Johhar Kessen, under the authority of Lord Vader you are to come with us.'
    mis_sas_12_e_outro3 "Oh? Sure, why not? I bet you can make me a better offer... can't you General?"
    mis_sas_12_e_outro4 "Good work, Operative. By denying the traitorous Rebel Kessen's influence and connections, we've dealt them a stronger blow than any destroyed base or ship."
    mis_sas_12_r_intro1 'Johhar Kessen is a former senator, partner. Connected all over the galaxy, and a legendary hunter to boot, if you believe the stories.'
    mis_sas_12_r_intro2 "Empire locked him up to keep the people on his planet in line, but if we spring him, we can get him to side with the Alliance. Let's do this."
    mis_sas_12_r_intro3 'This is it, Agent. Deploy Leia, Han Solo, and Chewbacca and destroy the shield generator so we can send in the bombers to level the prison.'
    mis_sas_12_r_outro1 'Well, well, well. Rebel Alliance, eh? To what do I owe this timely jailbreak?'
    mis_sas_12_r_outro2 "We'll talk about that in detail, Senator Kessen. Trust me. For now, let's get out of here."
    mis_sas_12_r_outro3 "Good work, kid. It's been a pleasure."
    mis_sas_12_r_outro4 'Indeed, Agent. If we can get Kessen to use his influence to help the Alliance, this will have been a major victory. Very well done.'
    mis_sas_1_e_intro1 'Operative, I continue to hear good things about your performance under General Veers.'
    mis_sas_1_e_intro2 'I have been told to expect new orders for us soon, in the meantime continue to upgrade your base.'
    mis_sas_1_e_outro1 'We meet again, Operative. I have special orders from high command.'
    mis_sas_1_e_outro2 'We are going to strike at a number of Rebel facilities across this subsector in order to locate and capture a high value target. Prep your forces for departure.'
    mis_sas_1_r_intro1 'Agent, your recent success against Fort Sunfire and the depletion of the local Imperial forces leaves us with an advantage.'
    mis_sas_1_r_intro2 'I am working with Rebel command concerning how to best exploit our situation. In the meantime, continue your base upgrades.'
    mis_sas_1_r_outro1 "So, it's you Jennica speaks so highly of? Good to see you again. I'm glad you joined us."
    mis_sas_1_r_outro2 "My friends and I have a plan to catch the Empire unprepared, and you're going to help us."
    mis_sas_2_e_intro1 'Operative, the plan calls for us to place a mole within a smuggler group we know to be aiding the Rebels. Then, track their movements to identify Rebel bases.'
    mis_sas_2_e_intro2 'Once we know where they are located, we will begin the second phase. '
    mis_sas_2_e_intro3 "We'll need to cause significant damage to this Smuggler base in order to plant our mole. Get to it."
    mis_sas_2_e_outro1 'Good work. The mole has infiltrated the Smuggler group, and strategically positioned himself as member of the crew.'
    mis_sas_2_e_outro2 'We should soon begin to see the benefits of this plan. Return to base.'
    mis_sas_2_r_intro1 'Hey there, good to see you two again.'
    mis_sas_2_r_intro2 'Han Solo, right? I remember you from when we signed up.'
    mis_sas_2_r_intro3 "Right. Saponza isn't it? You and your partner are going to help us run a con on the local Moff. First step: hit this base."
    mis_sas_2_r_outro1 "What we're working on here is a little game I learned from a friend, called the Coruscant City Shuffle. It's a con game."
    mis_sas_2_r_outro2 'One of our guys is going to be left behind at this base and "defect". This\'ll be fun. Trust me, kid.'
    mis_sas_3_e_intro1 'Our mole has sent the signal. Our first target will be the base of a Rebel Agent.'
    mis_sas_3_e_intro2 "Once we capture the Rebel Agent's base, we will make it appear as if we have a defector feeding us information on Rebel movements."
    mis_sas_3_e_outro1 'Great work. We are looking to find a valuable former senator named Johhar Kessen. With his support, we should be able to find the location Rebel high command fled to after Yavin. '
    mis_sas_3_e_outro2 "Operative, the mole reports there's a Rebel attack being launched on your base. Prepare your defenses to fight infantry."
    mis_sas_3_r_intro1 'Our mole has sent the signal. The Empire bought his "defection", and we\'re going to target one of their Operatives for an attack.'
    mis_sas_3_r_intro2 "Good. He'll tell them where we'll attack, but not soon enough for them to stop it. Once they trust his intel, we got 'em hooked."
    mis_sas_3_r_outro1 "The Empire knows that attack came from this base. They'll have to send an attack in reply."
    mis_sas_3_r_outro2 'All part of the plan, princess. All part of the plan.'
    mis_sas_4_e_intro1 'Infantry incoming. Rebel attack!'
    mis_sas_4_e_intro2 'Rebels favor sending large infantry forces. Mortars would be prudent.'
    mis_sas_4_e_outro1 "It's a bit strange for the Empire to be doing this kind of thing, ain't it? Usually they like to bust in the front door, guns blazin'."
    mis_sas_4_e_outro2 'Kind of a nice change of pace, if you ask me.'
    mis_sas_4_r_intro1 "You called it, Solo. We've got a lot of infantry inbound."
    mis_sas_4_r_intro2 'With their local garrison depleted of vehicles, this is all they have on hand. Mortars will make short work of them.'
    mis_sas_4_r_outro1 'The plan is that the mole will feed the Empire intel to keep them guessing while we go after the real target.'
    mis_sas_4_r_outro2 "We've got more misdirection to lay before we do that though, so let's get to it."
    mis_sas_5_e_intro1 'Operative, we need to be able to field large forces rapidly. Your barracks is already upgraded to level 4.'
    mis_sas_5_e_intro2 'You can support multiple barracks, and they can work simultaneously to train a large force quickly. Get to it.'
    mis_sas_5_e_outro1 'The plan is taking shape. Our mole is feeding all kinds of disinformation to the Rebel forces. They will spread themselves thin trying to capitalize on "weaknesses".'
    mis_sas_5_e_outro2 'While they do that, we shall locate Senator Kessen for capture. Clever plan, General.'
    mis_sas_5_r_intro1 "I like working with this Solo character, partner. He's one smooth scoundrel."
    mis_sas_5_r_intro2 "Saponza, I echo your sentiment. While the next phase of this operation is being planned, please make sure your barracks are fully upgraded and ready for what's coming."
    mis_sas_5_r_outro1 "The plan's simple: by getting the Empire to spread their forces thinly in this subsector, we can hit something important."
    mis_sas_5_r_outro2 "Something we wouldn't normally be able to risk."
    mis_sas_6_e_intro1 'Intelligence section is searching all data records you capture from the Rebel facilities. This is very valuable work you are doing, Operative.'
    mis_sas_6_e_intro2 'Destroy this Rebel base, Operative. They must be forced to keep guessing where we will strike.'
    mis_sas_6_e_outro1 'Good work so far. Keep it up.'
    mis_sas_6_r_intro1 "I like this plan, Mr. Solo. I'd never have thought you'd know so much about subterfuge."
    mis_sas_6_r_intro2 "Lady, clearly you've never had to dodge Imperial blockades or bluff dockmasters. Trust me. We've got this."
    mis_sas_6_r_outro1 'The plan appears to be working, Agent. I am getting reports of the Empire redistributing forces across the subsector.'
    mis_sas_7_e_intro1 'Our mole has fed us the location of another Rebel base. Destroy it.'
    mis_sas_7_e_outro1 'The mole reports that another attack is imminent.'
    mis_sas_7_e_outro2 'Return to base and prepare to fight an armored engagement.'
    mis_sas_7_r_intro1 "Keeping the Empire off-balance is critical now. If they don't know where we will hit, they will spread themselves too thin."
    mis_sas_7_r_outro1 "The Empire is massing for another attack, well before they've replenished their strength."
    mis_sas_7_r_outro2 "We're also keeping them busy in other parts of the outer rim, so they can't reinforce any one garrison to full strength."
    mis_sas_8_e_intro1 "Incoming force! It's vehicles."
    mis_sas_8_e_outro1 'Good. The Rebels appear disorganized and desperate. We have identified a high value target to go after.'
    mis_sas_8_e_outro2 'Johhar Kessen was once an influential senator, but is now a "guest" of the Rebels while they try to earn his favor. We will put a stop to that.'
    mis_sas_8_r_intro1 "Incoming force! Just a few vehicles. They're really getting low on forces."
    mis_sas_8_r_outro1 "Great job. They should be pretty confused about what we're doing, and low enough on defenders that we can start looking for Senator Kessen."
    mis_sas_8_r_outro2 "Yeah, but we've got to find that senator first. We can't spring him if we don't know where they're keeping him. I've got an idea though."
    mis_sas_9_e_intro1 'Operative, we have discovered a large contingent of Rebel infantry at this location. Destroy them all.'
    mis_sas_9_e_outro1 'Excellent. The Rebels are going to have to go into hiding at this rate. They will leave the base they are keeping the Senator at exposed.'
    mis_sas_9_r_intro1 'A platoon of Stormtroopers are at this base awaiting transit to reinforce some smaller bases, Agent. Take them out.'
    mis_sas_9_r_outro1 "Okay, good job there kid. Now it's time to make them look right, when we're about to go left."
    mis_sotm_10_e_intro1 "Partner, something tells me we're going to need more men in future battles. Let's build another [F2D62F]Unit Transport[-] and upgrade it to level 2."
    mis_sotm_10_e_outro1 'I like your... initiative, Operative. We have learned much, following your raid on that Rebel base.'
    mis_sotm_10_e_outro2 'We now suspect several mercenary groups here on Tatooine of secretly aiding the Rebels. You will continue to work with the Hutt to identify and destroy them.'
    mis_sotm_10_r_intro1 "Partner, something tells me we're going to need to be able to send more troops into battle. Let's upgrade the [F2D62F]Unit Transport[-]."
    mis_sotm_10_r_outro1 'Prudent initiative on upgrading the Unit Transport. The data we got from the Empire base is decoded.'
    mis_sotm_10_r_outro2 "Agent, I won't lie... This is bad news: Jabba got us mixed up in a feud between his cartel and other Hutts. We need to deal with the rest of the mercenaries before they can regroup and reinforce."
    mis_sotm_11_e_intro1 'Ahh, good to see you again Imperial. I see you understand how to follow orders unquestioningly. A useful trait in your Empire.'
    mis_sotm_11_e_intro2 "I look forward to watching you finish dealing with my master's enemies."
    mis_sotm_11_e_outro1 'A most spectacular effort, Imperial. I will embellish it suitably with mighty Jabba.'
    mis_sotm_11_r_intro1 'Ahh, good to see you again "Rebel Commander". I see you\'ve realized you have no choice but to defeat the remaining mercenaries that oppose my master.'
    mis_sotm_11_r_intro2 "I look forward to watching you finish dealing with sublime Jabba's enemies."
    mis_sotm_11_r_outro1 'A most spectacular effort, Rebel Commander. I will embellish it suitably with Mighty Jabba.'
    mis_sotm_12_e_intro1 'Operative, this is the last base of the Rebel sympathizers. Destroy it.'
    mis_sotm_12_e_intro2 "But maintain caution. Trusting a Hutt is a fool's undoing. Pay no attention to anything the scum might say that sounds... treasonous. "
    mis_sotm_12_e_outro1 'It has been a... pleasure working with you, Imperial.'
    mis_sotm_12_r_intro1 'Agent, this is the last of the mercenary bases. If we destroy it we should be able to feign ignorance if the Hutts try to find out who attacked their interests.'
    mis_sotm_12_r_intro2 'Once that is done, we can put this business with Jabba behind us and concentrate on the real threat.'
    mis_sotm_12_r_outro1 'It has been a pleasure working with you, Rebel Commander. Have a safe trip back to your tiny outpost.'
    mis_sotm_13_e_intro1 "We're under attack!"
    mis_sotm_13_e_outro1 'Intelligence section has identified these mercenaries, Operative. They belong to none other than Jabba the Hutt himself.'
    mis_sotm_13_e_outro2 'Whatever madness compels the Hutt to believe he can get away with this matters not. I will brook no insolence from criminals. Ready your forces.'
    mis_sotm_13_r_intro1 "We're under attack!"
    mis_sotm_13_r_outro1 "More mercenaries? Wait... these aren't the ones we fought before. I'd bet a million credits Jabba sent them. He's probably trying to capture us and sell us to the Empire!"
    mis_sotm_13_r_outro2 'We need to teach this Hutt a lesson on staying out of our business. Prepare your forces, I know how to hit Jabba, and make it hurt.'
    mis_sotm_14_e_intro1 "Intelligence has identified this as a storage ground for the Hutt's Contraband."
    mis_sotm_14_e_intro2 'You will confiscate all his Contraband and credits. The Empire is not to be trifled with, not even by Jabba the Hutt.'
    mis_sotm_14_e_outro1 'What is the meaning of this?! My master paid your "protection" money, Kosh! You made assurances! The mercenaries were destroyed and we all profited!'
    mis_sotm_14_e_outro2 'Silence, criminal scum! Your duplicity has been punished. Withhold from me again, and you will suffer even worse.'
    mis_sotm_14_e_outro3 'Now, Operative, forget about this... unseemly affair and return to your duties.'
    mis_sotm_14_e_outro4 'The all-powerful Jabba will hear of this, Kosh! Mark my words...'
    mis_sotm_14_r_intro1 "Agent, this is one of the places Jabba's cartel uses to smuggle goods offworld. The defenses are strong, but there's Credits there for the taking."
    mis_sotm_14_r_intro2 'If we take all these Credits, it will hit Jabba where it hurts and send a strong message.'
    mis_sotm_14_r_outro1 'What is the meaning of this?! How dare you attack the interests of my master!'
    mis_sotm_14_r_outro2 'Shut it, you sleazy nerf herder. This is what you get for trying to play us.'
    mis_sotm_14_r_outro3 'Consider us even. And remember this the next time you think about trying to blackmail or attack the Rebellion.'
    mis_sotm_14_r_outro4 'We will indeed remember. Nobody crosses Jabba the Hutt and lives. Nobody...'
    mis_sotm_1_e_intro1 "Now that we have some breathing room, we should build a [F2D62F]Proton Mortar[-]. It's a turret that can decimate groups of enemies with every shot."
    mis_sotm_1_e_outro1 "Great! I can't wait to see it in action. We can support two turrets per HQ level. I'll leave the decision of what to build to you."
    mis_sotm_1_r_intro1 "Now that we have some breathing room we should build a [F2D62F]Proton Mortar[-]. It's a turret that can decimate groups of enemies with every shot."
    mis_sotm_1_r_outro1 "Great! I can't wait to see it in action. We can support another turret as well, I'll leave the decision of what to build to you, partner."
    mis_sotm_2_e_intro1 'Operative, I have been contacted by the local Hutt with a... proposition.'
    mis_sotm_2_e_intro2 'In exchange for valuable intel on the Rebels, you will eliminate some mercenaries for him.'
    mis_sotm_2_e_intro3 'Before the operation can begin, however, you must upgrade a  [F2D62F]Barracks[-].'
    mis_sotm_2_e_outro1 "Working for a Hutt? Something's fishy about this, partner. Let's keep an eye on Kosh. I don't think he's telling us the whole story."
    mis_sotm_2_r_intro1 'Ahh, the mercenary has taken up the righteous cause of the Rebels. How unfortunate that the Empire hates them so.'
    mis_sotm_2_r_intro2 'It would be a shame if someone was to inform the Empire of a Rebel base on Tatooine. Perhaps we can come to an arrangement...'
    mis_sotm_2_r_intro3 'To work for most sublime Jabba, you will need more options in battle. A stronger Barracks, perhaps.'
    mis_sotm_2_r_outro1 "I don't like this, partner. Jennica ain't going to be too happy to see us using Rebel resources to help Hutts."
    mis_sotm_3_e_intro1 "Operative, this is Jabba the Hutt's majordomo. He will be your point of contact for the following operations. Do as he says for the time being."
    mis_sotm_3_e_intro2 'Ahh, we meet again. I am [F2D62F]Bib Fortuna[-], and as I serve my master, Jabba the Hutt. Now you serve me. Destroy this mercenary rabble and then we will speak again.'
    mis_sotm_3_e_outro1 'The glorious Jabba is engaged in a... dispute with the duplicitous employers of this mercenary band, and several others on Tatooine.'
    mis_sotm_3_e_outro2 'In our business, open aggression is unprofitable. The Empire, however, has a well known distaste for rabble such as these mercenaries. '
    mis_sotm_3_r_intro1 "Okay, let's get this over with. What does Jabba want?"
    mis_sotm_3_r_intro2 'Sublime Jabba wishes several mercenary camps... dealt with. Destroy this one, then we shall speak again.'
    mis_sotm_3_r_outro1 'Glorious Jabba is engaged in a dispute with the duplicitous employers of this mercenary band, and several others on Tatooine.'
    mis_sotm_3_r_outro2 'In our business, open aggression is unprofitable, so you shall deal with this rabble instead.'
    mis_sotm_4_e_intro1 'These mercenaries, too, are enemies of mighty Jabba. Destroy them if you wish to receive the data on your Rebel enemies.'
    mis_sotm_4_e_outro1 "These mercenaries work for a shadowy group with a long reach across the galaxy. They are arrayed against my master's interests, and therefore yours. "
    mis_sotm_4_r_intro1 'These mercenaries, too, are enemies of Mighty Jabba. Destroy them.'
    mis_sotm_4_r_outro1 "This mercenary rabble works for a shadowy group with a long reach across the galaxy. They are arrayed against my Master's interests, and therefore yours. "
    mis_sotm_5_e_intro1 "This is another base belonging to the mercenaries sent to interfere with my master's operations. See it destroyed."
    mis_sotm_5_e_outro1 'Operative, we no longer need to continue this arrangement. While you were engaged in that battle, intelligence section intercepted a transmission of great importance.'
    mis_sotm_5_e_outro2 'We have identified the location of a Rebel base. You will begin immediate preparation for an assault.'
    mis_sotm_5_r_intro1 'This is another base of the mercenary companies sent to interfere with my Master. See them destroyed.'
    mis_sotm_5_r_outro1 'Agent, I am seeing reports of your forces attacking mercenaries in the desert. These mercenaries are connected.'
    mis_sotm_5_r_outro2 "You've inserted us in the middle of a Hutt feud! I have an idea how to extricate us from this, but you're not going to like it."
    mis_sotm_6_e_intro1 'Operative, the mercenary groups you targeted for the Hutt have foolishly mobilized an attack against your garrison. Prepare yourself.'
    mis_sotm_6_e_outro1 "Something doesn't smell right about this, partner. Mercenaries attacking the Empire? That's crazy."
    mis_sotm_6_r_intro1 "Agent, the mercenaries you've been attacking work for a very powerful and influential underworld group. We may have inadvertently... wait... what's that sound?"
    mis_sotm_6_r_outro1 '"Rabble" indeed. We\'ve been played. I should have known better, partner. Never trust a Hutt.'
    mis_sotm_7_e_intro1 "This fight is heating up, partner. Let's maximize our defenses with at least six [F2D62F]Turrets[-]."
    mis_sotm_7_e_outro1 'Okay, that will help, but we can do more.'
    mis_sotm_7_r_intro1 "Partner, we picked a fight with some bad people. Let's maximize our defenses by building at least six [F2D62F]Turrets[-], ASAP."
    mis_sotm_7_r_outro1 'Okay, that will help, but we can do more.'
    mis_sotm_8_e_intro1 "Let's build some more [F2D62F]Walls[-]. We can support forty right now, so that's a good number to go for."
    mis_sotm_8_e_outro1 'Operative, your garrison is sufficiently stocked with walls for now. It is time to refocus your efforts on something more important.'
    mis_sotm_8_e_outro2 'You will attack a well defended Rebel base in this next engagement. Be ready.'
    mis_sotm_8_r_intro1 "Let's build some more [F2D62F]Walls[-]. We can support forty right now, so that's a good number to go for."
    mis_sotm_8_r_outro1 'Agent, while you have been busy I have tracked down a lead that will be very valuable. '
    mis_sotm_8_r_outro2 "But... we need to steal data from the [F2D62F]Empire[-]. Prepare your forces and set out when ready. I'll brief you when you get there."
    mis_sotm_9_e_intro1 'Operative, Rebel bases hold valuable intelligence about their activity. Attack a Rebel base, destroy what you can, and retrieve the data.'
    mis_sotm_9_e_outro1 'Adequate job, Operative. Intelligence section will immediately begin the analysis of recovered intelligence.'
    mis_sotm_9_r_intro1 'Agent, most Imperial bases hide several intelligence relay mainframes. Attack an Imperial base and destroy what you can. We need that intel.'
    mis_sotm_9_r_outro1 'Good work, Agent. I will begin analyzing the data you captured, immediately.'
    mis_tat_10_e_intro1 'You again?! You must want that shipment I hijacked, eh? Whatever it is must be really valuable!'
    mis_tat_10_e_intro2 'You have stolen a shipment meant for Lord Vader himself, smuggler. Lay down your arms and I will treat you and your men mercifully.'
    mis_tat_10_e_intro3 'Pfft, you want it? Come and get it, bucket-head.'
    mis_tat_10_e_outro1 'This smuggler is resilient, but she will eventually lose. The Empire cannot be beaten, regardless of the intentions of traitors and thieves.'
    mis_tat_11_e_intro1 "This is your last base, Liana Kor. I'll give you one last chance to hand over the stolen shipment, and surrender."
    mis_tat_11_e_intro2 'Go choke on your own blaster, fascist.'
    mis_tat_11_e_intro3 'Very well. Operative, the shipment is here. Show these traitors and smugglers no mercy.'
    mis_tat_11_e_outro1 "Sir, the smuggler woman appears to have escaped during the battle. We aren't sure how."
    mis_tat_11_e_outro2 "It doesn't matter. We've done what we were ordered to do. I'll be returning to Lord Vader now."
    mis_tat_11_e_outro3 'Operative, I am quite impressed. I foresee a bright future for you in the Empire. Return to Tatooine and continue your work there.'
    mis_tat_12_e_intro1 "I'm back! You didn't think I spent all that money on Dandoran for nothing did you, Imperial?"
    mis_tat_12_e_intro2 "Now you're going to know what it feels like when the iron jackboot comes after your home. Attack!"
    mis_tat_12_e_outro1 "Operative, the battle isn't over yet. Intelligence has traced the source of the smuggler's transmission."
    mis_tat_12_e_outro2 'She is in an approaching AT-AT. Likely stolen from the garrison on Dandoran. Prepare yourself, an AT-AT is a fearsome opponent.'
    mis_tat_13_e_intro1 'Die, fascist! This is for everyone you killed! This is justice!'
    mis_tat_13_e_intro2 'Heavy armor incoming! Protect the HQ!'
    mis_tat_13_e_outro1 'Sir, we found the woman in the wreckage of the AT-AT. She is alive, though badly wounded. Orders?'
    mis_tat_13_e_outro2 'We need to know who she was working with and how deep this corruption into our ranks runs.'
    mis_tat_13_e_outro3 'Have her sent to the mines on Kessel. She will talk, or she will work.'
    mis_tat_13_e_outro4 'Carry on, Operative.'
    mis_tat_1_e_intro1 "That's the place, guys! Burn it down!"
    mis_tat_1_e_outro1 "Imperial dogs! You'll get yours! Mark my words!"
    mis_tat_1_e_outro2 "Who was that? The girl's got guts. A bit dim to be attacking an Imperial garrison, but still... gutsy."
    mis_tat_1_e_outro3 'Sir, we were able to follow the speeder the girl was in, as it fled. Should we pursue?'
    mis_tat_1_e_outro4 'I guess we should. Mount up.'
    mis_tat_2_e_intro1 'Huh, not a bad little base. Cozy, even.'
    mis_tat_2_e_intro2 "You followed me? Big mistake. They don't call me Iron Liana for nothing!"
    mis_tat_2_e_outro1 'Sir, the smuggler captain and some of her crew escaped during the fight. I\'ve sent scouts to search for this "Iron Liana".'
    mis_tat_2_e_outro2 "Iron Liana? I remember hearing about her once on Nar Shaddaa. Way I hear it, they call her that cos she's stubborn as a zakkeg, and twice as mean."
    mis_tat_2_e_outro3 'Wonder why she decided to get all hot and bothered at us, of all people?'
    mis_tat_3_e_intro1 "Captain Kosh, I have not yet received the shipment of Obi-Wan Kenobi's artifacts you promised me. I am... displeased."
    mis_tat_3_e_intro2 'Lord Vader! I assure you, I shall immediately get to the bottom of this matter!'
    mis_tat_3_e_intro3 "Operative, we're going to go find that shipment. Make sure you have sufficient Unit Transport capacity, immediately! Lord Vader must not be kept waiting."
    mis_tat_3_e_outro1 'Luckily for you, Operative, I placed a homing beacon in that shipment. It looks to have been diverted to the planet of Dandoran.'
    mis_tat_3_e_outro2 'Take your forces and retrieve the shipment immediately. To fail me is to fail Lord Vader himself!'
    mis_tat_4_e_intro1 "Ahh, you must be the Operatives on Tatooine I've heard so much about. I am General Veers. Lord Vader has assigned me to locate his lost shipment."
    mis_tat_4_e_intro2 "Dandoran's Governor has failed to respond to hails, and his base's automated defenses are still engaged. I see you have forces. Use them."
    mis_tat_4_e_outro1 'It is as I thought. The Governor has betrayed the Empire. Since you are here, you will assist me.'
    mis_tat_5_e_intro1 'Imperial technology sold to lowly smugglers and mercenaries? Unacceptable. Destroy it all.'
    mis_tat_5_e_outro1 'I approve of your tactics, Operative. Kosh speaks poorly of you, but he is obviously feeling threatened by your skills as a commander.'
    mis_tat_5_e_outro2 "I will see to it Lord Vader is informed of this... inconsistency in Kosh's reporting."
    mis_tat_6_e_intro1 'The fortifications of this base could prove difficult to overcome. Providencially, I have a squadron of Dewbacks on-board my ship.'

    mis_tat_6_e_outro3 'Operative, I must make a lengthy report to Lord Vader. Return to Tatooine and await further orders.'
    mis_tat_7_e_intro1 'Dewbacks are native to Tatooine, partner. I bet if we upgrade the Barracks, we can accommodate the space for them.'
    mis_tat_7_e_outro1 'Yep, I called it. We can train our own Dewbacks now.'
    mis_tat_7_e_outro2 'Operative, General Veers has contacted me and requested you return to Dandoran to continue searching for the missing shipment.'
    mis_tat_8_e_intro1 'Welcome back to Dandoran. Lord Vader commands we defeat the traitors here, and recover his missing shipment.'
    mis_tat_8_e_intro2 'And whatever Lord Vader commands, we do. Get to it, Operative.'
    mis_tat_8_e_outro1 'I continue to be impressed by your skills as a tactician. Keep up the good work.'
    mis_tat_9_e_intro1 'What the... You followed me all the way to Dandoran?! Not satisfied with ruining me on Tatooine? Gotta do it here, too?'
    mis_tat_9_e_outro1 "You won't get me that easy, fascist! "
    mis_tih_1_e_intro1 'Operative, now that the Hutt situation is dealt with we must turn our attentions to more important matters. The Emperor wants the galaxy under heel.'
    mis_tih_1_e_intro2 'And that includes worthless outer rim planets like Tatooine. I shall begin drawing the necessary plans for Operation Iron Hand.'
    mis_tih_1_e_intro3 "While I do this begin the process of upgrading your outpost's alloy production facilities."
    mis_tih_1_e_outro1 "I'll be a wookiee's uncle if Kosh actually thinks Tatooine can be conquered. It'll never work. And what about the Hutts?"
    mis_tih_1_e_outro2 "Does Kosh think Jabba is just going to sit on the dais and wait for the Stormtroopers to come knocking? Watch Kosh, partner. He's not telling us everything."
    mis_tih_2_e_intro1 'Operative, due to your recent successes I have been instructed to provide you with the ability to upgrade your forces.'
    mis_tih_2_e_intro2 'The Research Lab will allow you to improve your fighting forces.'
    mis_tih_2_e_outro1 'Acceptable job, Operative. Operation Iron Hand has begun, prepare to crush the enemies of the Empire.'
    mis_tih_2_e_outro2 "Acceptable? I don't like this guy, partner. I signed up to bring law and order, not get talked down to. And what enemies could the Empire have out here anyway?"
    mis_tih_3_e_intro1 'These local miscreants are known as [F2D62F]Jawas[-]. They engage in... unlicensed trade. Put a stop to their illegal operation permanently.'

    mis_tih_3_e_outro2 'Good work dealing with those desert vermin, Operative. Pay no mind to what that Jawa said. Return to base.'
    mis_tih_4_e_fail1 "I don't see any [F2D62F]rocket turrets[-] here. We should hit this place with a vehicle force to overwhelm the mortars and burst turrets."
    mis_tih_4_e_intro1 "Partner, I'm a bit worried about our base. We got all these walls but we ain't been upgrading 'em. We should get on that I think."
    mis_tih_4_e_outro1 'Good initiative on upgrading your walls, Operative. For now intelligence has identified a moisture farm in the desert with ties to smugglers.'
    mis_tih_4_e_outro2 'You will utilize a [F2D62F]veteran AT-ST[-] to show these criminals the price for smuggling.'
    mis_tih_4_r_fail1 "I don't see any [F2D62F]rocket turrets[-] here. We should hit this place with a vehicle force to overwhelm the mortars and burst turrets."
    mis_tih_5_e_fail1 "Mortars aren't a threat to a big bad AT-ST, but they hit the technicians behind them with their [F2D62F]splash damage[-]. We need to watch out for that."
    mis_tih_5_e_intro1 'Operative, I have assigned you a [F2D62F]veteran AT-ST[-] for this mission and two repair droids.'
    mis_tih_5_e_intro2 '[F2D62F]Repair droids[-] can fix vehicles. [1cdb2f]You will not be able to deploy any other forces.[-] Think strategically and do not fail me.'
    mis_tih_5_e_outro1 "What a load of bantha poodoo. What's Kosh thinkin' giving us such a small force? Good thing that AT-ST and his wrench-jockeys were so useful."
    mis_tih_5_r_fail1 "Mortars aren't a threat to a big bad AT-ST, but they hit the technicians behind them with their [F2D62F]splash damage[-]. We need to watch out for that."
    mis_tih_6_e_intro1 'Operative, I am surprised by your... resilience. Well done dealing with the moisture farm.'
    mis_tih_6_e_intro2 'Orbital surveillance indicated you have what appears to be an incoming series of repulsor tanks. They resemble older CIS models from the Clone Wars. This will hurt.'
    mis_tih_6_e_outro1 'I remember seeing those on the holonet when I was younger during the war. I wonder who sent those and where they came from.'
    mis_tih_7_e_intro1 "Partner let's get our credit production up to snuff. Things are getting pricey."
    mis_tih_7_e_outro1 'Good work upgrading your credit production, Operative. Intelligence has identified the origin of the tanks that attacked you earlier. Prepare your forces and attack when ready.'
    mis_tih_8_e_fail1 'Partner, this base is a big one. To take it all down we might want to split our forces and attack from multiple sides all at once.'
    mis_tih_8_e_intro1 'Operative, this smuggler den has a number of [F2D62F]mechanics[-] living in those houses. This is obviously the source of the illegal tanks.'
    mis_tih_8_e_intro2 'Destroy the houses, unit transports, and... "confiscate" all credits and Contraband. I have also apportioned a [F2D62F]2-M Tank[-] for you to show this criminal scum what true mechanical power is.'
    mis_tih_8_e_intro3 "Confiscate? How much you want to bet this is all going straight into Kosh's pockets?"
    mis_tih_8_e_outro1 'Passable work, Operative. Transfer all confiscated Contraband to sub-sector command immediately. You may keep the credits.'
    mis_tih_8_e_outro2 "And if I were you, I'd keep a tighter leash on your partner Saponza. His personal feelings are unimportant next to following orders. Remember that."
    mis_tih_8_e_outro3 'I will have a... special assignment for you shortly. Return to base and await further orders.'
    mis_tih_8_r_fail1 'Partner, this base is a big one. To take it all down we might want to split our forces and attack from multiple sides all at once.'

    mis_wos_10_r_intro2 'Indeed it is, Saponza. A Juggernaut is highly durable, and like the AT-AP, will aim itself at shield generators and other base defenses.'
    mis_wos_10_r_outro1 'Okay back to base, partner.'
    mis_wos_11_r_intro1 "Partner, you remember what I said about shooting a rancor? Cos I think we're seeing the result..."
    mis_wos_11_r_outro1 'Looks like that was just a patrol. Agent, I will have the equipment from that force disposed of elsewhere.'
    mis_wos_11_r_outro2 'Hopefully, we can make the Empire think something else happened while we finalize the plans to hit their major bases.'
    mis_wos_12_r_intro1 'Agent, the Rebel Alliance has access to schematics and plans for all kinds of weapons and equipment.'
    mis_wos_12_r_intro2 'You already have a Research Center, but you can also upgrade it to unlock even stronger units, vehicles, heroes, and other improvements.'
    mis_wos_12_r_outro1 'Good job, Agent.'
    mis_wos_13_r_intro1 'Hey partner, now that we got this fancy Factory, how about we upgrade it so we can build more of these machines ourselves?'
    mis_wos_13_r_outro1 "Can't wait to take these upgraded vehicles out for a spin!"
    mis_wos_13_r_outro2 "Agent, prepare your forces to attack a major Imperial target. Let's put all we've done into practice against a hardened target."
    mis_wos_14_r_intro1 "Agent, use everything you've built and learned up to this point to do as much damage as you can to an Imperial operative's base."
    mis_wos_14_r_outro1 "Good work, Agent. This was a very effective test of our capabilities. We can begin plotting the downfall of the Empire's main garrison here on Tatooine."
    mis_wos_1_r_fail1 "Agent, it is sometimes wise to only deploy a small force at first to see what defenders appear. Once you know what you're up against you can counter deploy your own forces."
    mis_wos_1_r_intro1 'Agent, my thanks for your prompt response to my beacon. This is part of the wreckage of the Atom Edge, a freighter that was to bring us vital supplies.'
    mis_wos_1_r_intro2 "As you can see, it broke up in orbit and crashed. There's evidence we aren't the first ones to reach the wreckage, so approach with caution. It may be a trap."
    mis_wos_1_r_outro1 "It worries me that the Empire got here so quickly. The cargo we need isn't here."
    mis_wos_1_r_outro2 'The ship broke into two pieces when it hit the atmosphere. What we need must be in the other half. Sending you the coordinates now.'
    mis_wos_1_r_tip1 'Rebel scum! Attack!'
    mis_wos_1_r_tip2 "It's a trap!"
    mis_wos_2_r_fail1 "Agent, it is sometimes wise to only deploy a small force at first to see what defenders appear. Once you know what you're up against you can counter deploy your own forces."
    mis_wos_2_r_intro1 'Someone beat us to this half of the Atom Edge too.'
    mis_wos_2_r_intro2 "They must have left those Auto-Turrets behind so they could come back and get whatever they didn't claim this time. We need to search that ship."
    mis_wos_2_r_outro1 "Ma'am, we didn't find the crates you are looking for, but we did find evidence that smugglers or mercenaries were the ones who got here first."
    mis_wos_2_r_outro2 'Well done, Soldier. Agent, track the stolen shipments and get us those cargo crates.'
    mis_wos_3_r_intro1 'This is where the trail leads. Waiting on your orders to deploy.'
    mis_wos_3_r_outro1 'Excellent work recovering the cargo, Agent. This will allow us to greatly expand the scope of our operations in this sector.'
    mis_wos_4_r_intro1 'Agent, the cargo you recovered contains necessary components to construct our own Factory facility, and build our own vehicles locally.'
    mis_wos_4_r_intro2 'First, you need to upgrade your HQ to level four. To accommodate the equipment, you will need to build a Factory.'
    mis_wos_4_r_outro1 'Good work so far, Agent. Several vehicles survived the crash. I will instruct you in their use in the field.'
    mis_wos_5_r_fail1 'Partner, these X-wings and Bombers can hit multiple targets if you aim right. Take your time and make sure you pick targets carefully.'
    mis_wos_5_r_intro1 'Agent, a bomber squadron on patrol of the sector located this Empire listening post. They need you to give them targets.'
    mis_wos_5_r_intro2 'Try to destroy everything if possible. And may the Force be with you, Agent.'
    mis_wos_5_r_outro1 "Commendable work, Agent. I'll meet you back at your base."
    mis_wos_6_r_intro1 'To construct vehicles, you will need a Factory. Build one as soon as you can.'
    mis_wos_6_r_outro1 'Vehicles are stronger than the average infantryman, but also more expensive and take up more space in your Unit Transport.'
    mis_wos_7_r_intro1 "We've got incoming! Imperial attack!"
    mis_wos_7_r_outro1 'As you can see, Agent, vehicles can be very deadly when used effectively. The Empire has mastered this, and we must catch up.'
    mis_wos_7_r_outro2 "Now... let's focus our attention on the Empire's desert outposts, shall we?"
    mis_wos_8_r_intro1 "I have provided you with two types of tanks for this battle. T2-B tanks are lightly armed and suited to a general role. AAT-1's however are more durable, and go straight for defensive turrets."
    mis_wos_8_r_intro2 'Deploy your forces with these targeting preferences and roles in mind, to achieve victory.'
    mis_wos_8_r_outro1 "I love the sight of exploding Imperial turrets! Let's keep at it, partner."
    mis_wos_9_r_intro1 "Speeder Bikes prefer to target enemy units. These big walkers, called AT-APs, go straight for shields and bring 'em down."
    mis_wos_9_r_outro1 'Boom! Ha ha! This is like shooting rancors in a cage.'
    mis_wos_9_r_outro2 'And by that I mean "easy, but sure to come back and bite you in the rear, later". Know what I mean?'
